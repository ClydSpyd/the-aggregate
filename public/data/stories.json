I think it will also be a perfect frame for our art,’ Louise said of the blue.\n\n‘I’m obsessed with this peach colour which changes throughout the day, as I type it looks much paler than it appears in this picture.\n\n‘Gordon says it reminds him of that beautiful light that comes in the window at sunrise and sunset and I think he’s exactly right.",

Everyone just needs to get to the airport.”\n\nCammack told Fox that it “speaks volumes of not just the administration, and how they handled this utter, total failure, but Democrat leadership in general,” adding that “When the Speaker of the House is saying that ‘Everything should be in a good place, everybody just needs to get to the airport’ it took me about 10 minutes just to get my jaw up off the desk.”\n\n“I couldn’t believe that when we have left Americans behind, when we have one of the worst examples of an American military failure, no contingency plans in place, and the Speaker of the House is saying ‘everything seems fine’ Madam Speaker, you can’t just take an Uber to the airport! Not a casual stroll through the street” stated Rep. Cammack on Rep. Pelosi. \n\nCammack also commented on the mixed messaging over the current status of the region, claiming that some sources are telling people to stay in place while mainstream media has been naive about the threat posed by the Taliban.\n\nCammack reported that her office is working on getting 187 Americans home, and they are just from Florida’s third congressional district alone.\n\nHowever, according to Cammack, the State Department is still telling Americans to go to the airport .”",

      "summary": "\n\nBiden in remarks at the White House on Sunday noted that the terror group is a “sworn enemy of the Taliban” and said that the longer U.S. troops are on the ground increases the chance that the group will attempt to strike innocent civilians and American personnel near the Hamid Karzai International Airport.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul has been warning Americans to avoid traveling to the airport in part because of concerns about Islamic State fighters.\n\nThe extremist group has long declared a desire to attack America and U.S. interests abroad and it has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority.\n\nThe group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, and faced Taliban attacks.\n\nMORE ON THE CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN:\n\n— China both worries and hopes as US departs Afghanistan\n\n— AP PHOTOS: President Joe Biden says 11,000 individuals were evacuated from Kabul over the weekend and he remains committed to assisting all Americans who want to leave Afghanistan get out.\n\n In a statement on Twitter, Laurie Bristow said the “huge effort” to move evacuees out of Afghanistan is “gathering pace” but that there is still “a huge amount of work to do.”\n\nBristow said he is in the evacuation handling center in Kabul where soldiers, diplomats and forces have been “working around the clock to get our British nationals, Afghan colleagues and Embassy staff to safety.”\n\nIn addition to the 4,000 or so U.K. nationals, there are thought to be around 5,000 Afghan allies, such as translators and drivers, who are earmarked for a seat on a British plane.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Bahrain says its national carrier is flying people to the United States as part of efforts to evacuate people from Afghanistan a week after the Taliban takeover.\n\nThe U.S.-allied kingdom said Sunday that a Gulf Air flight will transport people from its Isa Air Base to Dulles International Airport south of Washington, DC.\n\nThe official statement said the flight was an “affirmation of the Kingdom of Bahrain’s efforts to protect lives.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, the Pentagon activated the initial stage of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, asking for 18 aircraft from American carriers to help transport Americans and Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort.\n\nThe commercial airlines will be used to transport people from third countries to their final destinations, allowing the U.S. military to focus on evacuating people from Afghanistan.\n\n he was not able to get in touch for two weeks.\n\nEzat, a co-organizer of the gathering who asked not to be identified by his last name, said the Taliban “are taking back all freedoms we had until now and for 20 years.”\n\nHe called on France to welcome refugees because “it’s not the Taliban who are fleeing the country, it’s people whose lives are in danger.”\n\nMacron said Monday that France would “do its duty to protect those who are most at risk,” but also said Europeans must “protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows.”\n\nFrance has evacuated almost 600 people from Kabul since Monday, most of them Afghan citizens who worked with the French government or French groups in Afghanistan.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates— The world’s largest organization of Muslim nations held an extraordinary session in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, with calls for it not to be turned into a hub for terrorism.",

      "summary": "\n\nLebanon has been slowly unraveling economically over the past two decades, with the crisis truly beginning in the fall of 2019, and escalating significantly after the famous Beirut port explosion in August of last year. The central bank was able to prop up this spending for several years after the economy was restructured to be based around foreign investments and the de-incentivization of labour productivity in the country. However, government officials have a history of “malign neglect,” which is an approach that has been adopted in an attempt to avoid the political class taking accountability for any economic issues for fear of angering the business class that controls them or further polarizing the various sects that exist within the government. Lebanon has long fallen back on the idea that foreign countries will come to save them from their economic crises, as has been the case for the past few years.",

      "summary": "\n\nBiden in remarks at the White House on Sunday noted that the terror group is a \"sworn enemy of the Taliban\" and said that the longer U.S. troops are on the ground increases the chance that the group will attempt to strike innocent civilians and American personnel near the Hamid Karzai International Airport.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul has been warning Americans to avoid traveling to the airport in part because of concerns about Islamic State fighters.\n\nThe extremist group has long declared a desire to attack America and U.S. interests abroad and it has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority.\n\nThe group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, and faced Taliban attacks.\n\nMORE ON THE CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN:\n\n— China both worries and hopes as US departs Afghanistan\n\n— AP PHOTOS: \n\n— Biden vows to evacuate all Americans — and Afghan helpers\n\nHERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says 11,000 individuals were evacuated from Kabul over the weekend and he remains committed to assisting all Americans who want to leave Afghanistan get out.\n\n \n\nBristow said he is in the evacuation handling center in Kabul where soldiers, diplomats and forces have been \"working around the clock to get our British nationals, Afghan colleagues and Embassy staff to safety.\"\n\nIn addition to the 4,000 or so U.K. nationals, there are thought to be around 5,000 Afghan allies, such as translators and drivers, who are earmarked for a seat on a British plane.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Bahrain says its national carrier is flying people to the United States as part of efforts to evacuate people from Afghanistan a week after the Taliban takeover. \n\nThe official statement said the flight was an \"affirmation of the Kingdom of Bahrain's efforts to protect lives.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, the Pentagon activated the initial stage of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, asking for 18 aircraft from American carriers to help transport Americans and Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort.\n\nThe commercial airlines will be used to transport people from third countries to their final destinations, allowing the U.S. military to focus on evacuating people from Afghanistan.\n\nPARIS — About 200 people, mostly Afghan nationals, gathered in Paris on Sunday to show solidarity toward evacuees and refugees from Afghanistan, one week after the Taliban took power in the country.\n\nMany were brandishing posters writing \"Afghanlivesmatter\" and \"Evacuation now.\"\n\nSafi Matiullah, a 33-year-old Afghan who left his country two years ago and has been living in France for about nine months, said \"we want to bring our family here.\"\n\nMatiullah said his parents and sisters remained in Afghanistan amid \"big danger\" and he was not able to get in touch for two weeks.\n\nEzat, a co-organizer of the gathering who asked not to be identified by his last name, said the Taliban \"are taking back all freedoms we had until now and for 20 years.\"\n\nHe called on France to welcome refugees because \"it's not the Taliban who are fleeing the country, it's people whose lives are in danger.\"\n\nMacron said Monday that France would \"do its duty to protect those who are most at risk,\" but also said Europeans must \"protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows.\"\n\nFrance has evacuated almost 600 people from Kabul since Monday, most of them Afghan citizens who worked with the French government or French groups in Afghanistan.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates— The world's largest organization of Muslim nations held an extraordinary session in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, with calls for it not to be turned into a hub for terrorism.\n\nThe secretary general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Yousef al-Othaimeen, pointed to the escalating humanitarian needs in Afghanistan and noted that \"reconciliation is the key to bringing peace.\"\n\nThe OIC issued a statement after the meeting saying its member states called upon future Afghan leaders and the international community \"to ensure that Afghanistan is never used again as a platform or haven for terrorists, and not allow terrorist organizations to have a foothold there.\"\n\nThe OIC urged Afghan parties to renounce violence, work together and protect and respect the right to life and security in compliance with \"tolerant Islamic principles.\"\n\nMember states agreed on the need to provide humanitarian assistance in areas that need it most, though no new specific commitments were announced.",

      "summary": "However, experts say this is largely an illusion caused by a distressed population increasingly taking up low-paid informal jobs\n\n \n\nAnother key indicator on employment — the Worker Population Ratio, or the percentage of people aged 15 and above who are already employed — too has shown an improvement. \n\nLabour economist Santosh Mehrotra said the PLFS data established how India’s workforce had moved towards low-paid informal work, such as family work and farm work, in 2019-20.\n\n“The engagement of people increased in 2019-20; also, the share of people in unpaid family labour increased,” he said.\n\n“This means more people moved towards the informal sector and less remunerative jobs because of a decline of formal and secure jobs.”\n\nThe PLFS shows that 15.9 per cent people were engaged as “helpers in household enterprises” in 2019-20, up from 13.3 per cent in 2018-19, with such work attracting more women than men.\n\n“Employment as helpers in household enterprises mainly refers to unpaid family work, such as helping one’s husband run a snacks stall or doing some sort of work on (the family’s) farmland,” Mehrotra said.\n\n“These people are considered employed but get no payment. \n\nUnder the CWS, a person is considered employed if he or she has worked for over an hour in the preceding one week (from the time they are questioned for the survey).\n\n“Going by the CWS, the unemployment situation continues to be as grim in 2019-20 as in 2018-19 and 2017-18,” Mehrotra said.\n\nLabour economist Amitabh Kundu, currently adviser to Oxfam India, suggested that the “usual status” measure was unreliable in another way — many respondents might not clearly remember on how many days in the past one year they had worked at least an hour.\n\n“Under the current weekly status, the reference period is one week and there is no recall error,” he said.\n\nAccording to the PLFS, the unemployment rate under the CWS was 8.8 per cent for both 2019-20 and 2018-19.",

Too often, those pet owners, they're faced with devastating decisions about having to have their pets suffer without treatment, or euthanize them in some cases, or in some cases, they do surrender them to humane societies,” said Mark Patrick, president of Tails of Help. Successful applications will be referred to a local veterinarian for the necessary treatment while humane society and Tails of Help will pool together to cover the costs of the care.",

      "summary": "Aside from the need to be technologically adept, new entrepreneurs have to familiarize themselves and comply with a blizzard of government regulations, mainly on business registration, product registration, and taxation. TGFI founder and president Floi Wycoco, a former overseas Filipino worker, noted that before the pandemic, aspiring entrepreneurs could easily meet up with friends or attend government-sponsored events to pick up new money-making ideas. Getting a grasp of financial technology appears to be just as daunting for prospective buyers or customers: The TGFI survey found that while the use of online banking has jumped by 75 percent and e-wallets by 71 percent as preferred payment modes, 42 percent of the respondents still chose cash as their payment mode, and only 2 percent have been using credit cards to pay for their transactions.\n\nGovernment regulation and compliance, of course, remain the biggest worry for new entrepreneurs, such as getting a notice from the Bureau of Internal Revenue for everyone doing business using the internet to register by a set date and begin paying taxes. \n\nWhile the TGFI survey showed that the pandemic has been, for some Filipinos, a gritty learning experience that has compelled them to become more resourceful, creative, and enterprising in generating new income, what the survey also underlined is how these struggling entrepreneurs still need all the help they can get—mainly from the government via minimum regulation and red tape, and from big business via the reduced cost of learning, adopting, and earning from technology, as they now transition from workers and employees hit hard by the health and economic crises to hopeful entrepreneurs under the new normal.",

      "summary": "\n\nIn an online briefing, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno laid out a list of measures aimed at preventing the abuse of the enhanced powers the bill would give to bank examiners, including strict limits on the use of deposit information.\n\n“The results of the inquiry and examination by the BSP shall be for the exclusive use of the BSP,” he said. “They shall not be made available to any person or entity, except to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, Anti- Money Laundering Council, Department of Justice and the courts, provided that the sharing of the results of the said inquiry or examination is necessary to prevent or prosecute any offense or crime.”\n\nThe central bank chief explained that, under the BSP’s version of the proposed law, any inquiry would be limited to the deposit account of the stockholder, owner, director, trustee, officer or employee of an entity that was subject to the supervision or regulatory power of the BSP, the representative or agent, the related party, or any of the conspirators of the person involved in the commission of fraud, serious irregularity or unlawful activity. \n\nThe grounds for inquiry or examination of bank deposits are in the exercise of BSP’s supervisory powers, upon determination by the Monetary Board that there is reasonable ground to believe that a fraud, serious irregularity or unlawful activity has been or is being committed by the specified persons; and it is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud, irregularity or unlawful activity; and in the course of its investigation of closed banks.\n\nMore importantly, Diokno said the proposed law would give regulators the ability to look into foreign currency deposits in banks operating in the Philippines including off-shore branches of domestic banks—a section of the banking industry that was previously off limits to regulators due to strict provisions of a Marcos-era law governing it. \n\nThe proposed law also gives protection to banks and financial institutions against frivolous suits from depositors in connection with the inquiry and examination of deposits by the BSP; and considers as unlawful its use “for persecution or harassment or as an instrument to hamper competition in trade and commerce.”\n\n“The passage of the bill is seen to have wide-ranging beneficial impact,” Diokno said.",

Eljif Elmas got the second goal for Napoli, which had Victor Osimhen sent off in the first half for appearing to punch Venezia midfielder Daan Heymans.",

The German embassy also advised its citizens not to go to the airport, warning Taliban forces were conducting increasingly strict controls in its immediate vicinity. Afghans and international aid and advocacy groups have reported harsh retaliation against protests, and round-ups of those who had formerly held government positions, criticised the Taliban or worked with US-led forces.",

      "summary": "Phase 2 will develop site concepts and land-use plans.\n\n“The end of phase one has really been an effective proof of concept,” said Nicholas Dykstra, an urban designer with O2 Planning. \n\nHe said the vision is technically sound, and if timed with the right critical investments, can be realized.\n\n“The city understood that something comprehensive was required here, that the complexities of the waterfront – especially on the east end, but also on the west end – were pronounced and integrated, but not insurmountable.”\n\nAlthough re-development of the 296-acres of waterfront property is financially viable, that viability is not equally distributed across the area, according to Dykstra. \n\nHe said cohesive planning is required to unlock its full potential, otherwise certain strategic areas will get left behind.\n\nFor example, some of the designated area is upwards of four metres below flood-construction regulation levels, and a comprehensive-style dyke would have to be built, Dykstra said, adding that’s a huge challenge for a single landowner.\n\nBut no major barriers have been found relating to technical studies or land-use, a good sign as the team of designers, architects, engineers, and land economists moves into site design.\n\nMuch of the civic infrastructure is at the end of its lifecycle and needs upgrades regardless; the high-voltage powerlines across the Fraser River are anticipated to stay, but other electrical in the area would have to be placed underground; the soil profiles are fairly consistent with no broad-based concerns; and no immediate environmental issues have currently been identified, according to their report.\n\n“From an overall systems capacity, we’re in a very good position,” Dykstra said.\n\nCoun. Danny Plecas asked about soil contamination at the site, a remnant of the former industrial land-uses, particularly prevalent in the eastern sector.\n\nMore studies are needed to verify the risk across the entire site, but planners do not see it as a significant encumbrance for developers, said Dykstra. \n\nThey’ve created a “dot matrix” from decades of previous reports, and have highlighted areas of risk for future investigations, but he said so far, there’s nothing that would make industry uncomfortable.\n\n“There’s no giant creosote puddle, or anything that is a major stop that’s screaming out at the end of phase one,” Dykstra said, adding certain land uses don’t require full de-contamination, and can be capped rather than excavated.",
