Many viewers commented on the appearance of a large, dark patch of skin on Biden's left side of his jaw, which was not easily concealed by the skin bronzer covering Biden's face. The bruise also appeared in a photo taken by New York Times photographer Doug Mills of President Trump watching Biden's speech on Trump Force One following a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. The White House is scheduled to hold a briefing on the issue at 1:30 p.m. EDT Thursday.",

Prosecutors claim that Ashley wanted to get her husband out of her and her daughter's lives and would \"stop at nothing\" to achieve this goal. The defense claims that Doug Benefield was abusive and intimidating and had previously thrown a loaded gun at Ashley and punched their dog in the face so hard that he knocked the dog unconscious. The state argues that Ashley Benefedged was not injured and that she was armed with a gun she had previously bought while her husband was unarmed.",

Annabel, who has served as King Charles's chief designer of his estates for over 20 years, is reportedly being removed from the payroll after Prince William took over the Duchy of Cornwall. She was employed by the King, then Prince of Wales, and his wife, Queen Camilla, after his 2005 marriage to her elder sister, Charles. Despite this, Annabel has reportedly been not paid for her services as of 2023 to 2024. The Telegraph reports that Annabel received anywhere between £19,625 and £82,272 for her work, and receiving an additional £7,160 to £90,285 each year for stock and furniture. The pair have been seen together more frequently since Annabel's key role in the Coronation as her sister's companion and a pillar of support for her widowed younger sibling.",

She defeated California resident Ashton Besmer, who had previously beaten Shepherd 6-4 during the national duals. Shepherd credits his commitment to wrestling and willingness to seek out help from others to improve his wrestling. Despite initially weighing in at 0.4 pounds over the limit on the morning of the tournament, Shepherd's determination to succeed is a key part of his preparation for freestyle, which he prefers over folkstyle during the high school season.",

      "summary": "Kamala Harris, former California attorney general, has been known for supporting affordable housing and has proposed similar policies as a potential presidential candidate. Her proposed Rent Relief Act would offer tax credits to renters who earn below $100,000 and spend over 30% of their income on rent and utilities. This version includes a mechanism from the Treasury to pay the tax credit monthly to eligible households. The second version caps the credit at 100% of small area fair market rents instead of 150% of FMR. This comes as Harris announced the recipients of an $85 million grant under the Pathways to Removing Obstacles for Housing, or PRO Housing, aimed to increase building activity and lower housing and rental costs for families in the U.S. The LIFT the Middle Class Act would provide a refundable tax credit of up to $3,000 per person or $6,000 for married couples who file joint tax returns. Some experts suggest that the LIFT Act might be better for renters than the proposed 5% rent cap increase, which could lead to landlords losing access to tax breaks.",

The woman, who purchased the dirty shirt at an estate sale, revealed the change in the water after hand-washing the shirt and using stain remover. She warned other TikTok users that if they didn't wash their second-hand clothes, they could be wearing all of the grime on their bodies. Experts advise shoppers to never assume new clothes are clean and to properly sanitize their garments to prevent disease and make the most of their purchases.",

Fans were shocked to see him join the LaLiga minnows, with some expressing concern over his decline. Januzaj made his debut for Manchester United in the 2013 Community Shield and scored five goals and eight assists that hinted at plenty more to come.",

Despite being questioned at the scene and fleeing to Turkey, Northamptonshire Police eventually obtained a red notice to find and arrest a suspect in Bulgaria. In February 2024, he was brought back to the UK and sentenced to four years and four months in prison and disqualified from driving for five years and two months. The time it took for the investigation to bring KavAS to justice has significantly impacted the family's mental wellbeing and the loss of their father, who passed away in 2021.",

National police have arrived in the region to assist in the investigation, which took place over a week after the violence took place. The bodies of the victims were found floating in the surrounding bush and many were taken by crocodiles. The violence is part of a trend of violence towards land and wealth, following a similar attack in February in the Highlands.",

The article also highlights a new range of flavours, including those of Limoncello, which has seen a surge in Google searches for its recipes increasing by over 50% in the past three months. The new Tanqueray Paradiso, £27, from Sainsbury's, is set to bring carnival spririt to life with its blend of Brazilian guava, lemongrass, and London Dry gin. The Martini Simona Spritz is a popular spritz named after actress Simona Tabasco, and has a spritz called Martini Bianco. For rose wine fans, the new Rozel Rose Vodka spritz contains the UK's first luxe blush vodka - RozelRose Vodka - inspired by the raspberry and white peach fruits of Cotes de Provence rose wine. Pimm's is also a great way to spice up your summer with a refreshing spritz, combining ice with 50ml Pimm with fresh strawberry jam, basil leaves, and a dash of chilli, and fresh mint and chilli.",

This comes in response to criticism of the Logan Act, which he has been accused of violating. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delivered an address to Congress and is also meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Israeli leader's visit comes more than nine months into Israel's conflict against Hamas, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking approximately 250 people hostage. Israel has launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza, killing over 39,000 Palestinians.",

      "summary": "The UK's first prime minister, Keir Starmer, has been criticised for his lack of enthusiasm for the weekly PMQs, which he argues is boring and dull. The Telegraph and Independent newspapers criticised the new format of PMQAs as a \"love-in\", while The Times's sketch writer suggested that the new horses needed time to learn to bray. The session, which is now being broadcast globally by the BBC and is a favourite on America's C-Span network, is also a favourite with US's President George HW Bush. The House of Commons is notoriously resistant to reform, with MPs appearing in the show as a Greek chorus but constituents see what they are up to all day. The debate, which focuses on issues of the day, should be more frequent than a regular press conference. The current format of the PMQS is seen as an attempt to make it more engaging and engaging in a more engaging form of debate.",

While the women's event is a senior competition, men's teams are generally an under-23 event with up to three overage exceptions per squad. Players such as Colombian forward Caicedo, who starred at the World Cup last year, and Real Madrid, are expected to be a standout. Brazilian legend Marta, six-time World Player of the Year, will play at her sixth Olympic Games and will set a new record if she scores at them. Other notable players include Man City's Alvarez, Spain's Bonmati, and Man City’s Alvarez.",

This time, he will partner Noah Williams in the defending of his title.

The Park Fire, which quickly spread from 26 square kilometers to over 70 square miles (180 square kilometers), was only 3% contained early Thursday. Powerful winds and lightning strikes from thunderstorms have also caused fires in eastern Oregon, cutting power and fueling them. The largest active blaze in the United States is burning near the Oregon-Idaho border, causing the closure of Interstate 84 near Boise, Idaho. No deaths or damage to structures have been reported. In the Canadian Rockies’ largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage. The Durkee Fire, burning near Idaho’s Idaho border, crossed the interstate near Huntington, home to about 500 people, and merged with another large blaze nearby.",

The delivery of the fifth-generation jet by Lockheed Martin is expected to start in 2028, while Greece retains the option to purchase 20 additional F-5 jets as part an $8.6 billion deal. The purchase of the first 20 jets and additional support will cost around $3.5 billion. Greece is undergoing a decade-long program following a protracted financial crisis and ongoing tension with Turkey, which was excluded from the program five years ago due to its decision to buy Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system.",

Some media figures claimed this disproves conservatives' claim that the media has supported Biden. However, critics argue that this is an attempt to delegatatize Biden's position as a political figure. The media responded by using the term \"cheap fakes\" and smearing people who witnessed the truth as liars. They are now largely back to assisting their Democratic allies ahead of the election. Meanwhile, critics question whether Kamala Harris, who was tapped as Biden's Border Czar, should be allowed to face scrutiny due to her past administration failures and radical policy stances.",

      "summary": "An 83(b) election, a powerful tax planning tool for founders, employees, and executives with stock-based compensation, can accelerate the taxation of unvested company stock. The election, which minimizes taxable income and controls the timing of it, allows individuals to pay tax on these shares now, instead of when they vest. This includes paying tax on the taxable spread at grant, rather than when the stock vesting requirements. The difference between the exercise (or purchase) price and the current fair market value of the stock is taxable, either as ordinary income (for restricted stock and non-qualified stock options) or for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) calculation (for incentive stock options). The election can be made in conjunction with an early exercise of stock options or profits interests in an LLC or partnership. Startup founders, early employees, executives, and other service providers can also make an 83B election. The key benefit of this election is having more control over your tax situation and equity. An 83B) election can also be made to shift taxable income entirely to more favorable long-term rates. The eligibility period for this election includes qualifying small business stock (Section 1202) and qualifying for tax-free stock sales.",

The ministry condemned the Russian attacks as “unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law” Meanwhile, Ukraine has detained an 18-year-old suspect in connection with the shooting death of a former lawmaker advocating for the use of the Ukrainian language instead of Russian.",

This comes after Lopez celebrated her 55th birthday with a massive party and a swimsuit photo. The last time they were seen together was in early June at his son Samuel's basketball game. Despite this, Lopez has been seen with Ben's eldest daughter, Violet, and their Bel Air mansion is currently on the market for $68M. There are claims that neither Lopez nor Affleck have filed for divorce but are quietly working out their relationship behind the scenes to resolve issues.",

      "summary": "The Warren Group's June housing market report revealed that while the number of homes sold in Massachusetts fell in June, while the price of those homes also spiked. The report noted that both single-family home and condo sales decreased on a year-over-year basis, but still reached new all-time highs in June. The average home sale in June jumped from $615,000 in 2023 to $665,000 by 2024, an 8 percent increase and a new record for the month. Despite these record prices, higher mortgage interest rates have actually slowed price growth, but may have led to higher prices due to low inventory. Cassidy Norton, Associate Publisher and Media Relations Director of The Warren Group, suggested that high mortgage interest rate may actually be helping to buffer higher pricing jumps due to a lack of inventory. In 2024, there were 1,938 condominium sales in June 2024, a major decline from 2023, and the median sale price rose 5 percent on a yearly basis to $570,000.",

      "summary": "The revival of Charles Dickens' classic musical, Oliver!, has been reviewed by the Guardian for its timelessness and exquisite performances. The production, adapted from Dickens, features a score of Lionel Bart's songs and performances by Matthew Bourne, Matthew Bourse, Jean-Pierre van der Spuy, and Lez Brotherston. Despite the artistic excellence and musical performances, it feels safe, tame and nostalgic. Simon Lipkin plays Fagin, playing Fagin as a Jewish character who reflects his Jewish heritage, and Cian Eagle-Service plays the role of Oliver. Despite this, the production does acknowledge the problematic character of Fagin. The review concludes that the show could be renamed Fagin!",

The company, in a notice to the state’s Employment Development Department, announced that it is undertaking layoffs and departmental closures at 14 locations across California, including those in Glendora, Montebello, Covina, Pasadena, Long Beach, Redlands, Highlands, Los Angeles, Beaumont, Irvine, El Segundo, Cerritos and Hayward in Alameda County. The layoffs will begin in a series of eight waves beginning Sept. 16 and conclude in January 2025. Despite not providing a reason for the job cuts, Optum is open to shifting affected employees to open positions within the company. The firm declined to comment on the layoffs or whether severance pay would be offered. The move comes as part of a larger effort to address a new California law that will increase healthcare wages to a minimum floor of $25 hourly, which was delayed in June due to a budget deficit.",

The committee's leader, Virginia Foxx, has criticized the Education Department for not fully cooperating with federal investigations into changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFASA), which led to delays in the application process. The GAO has launched two separate investigations into the issue and confirmed its staff attended a summer conference for financial aid workers. Many congressional Republicans have criticized the administration's FAFSA rollout and support cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from the budget of the office that oversees the form. The move comes as Congress considers a bill to require the Education Dept. to release the next version of the FAFAS for financial assistance by Oct. 1, which was delayed until after Christmas.",

He suggested that delaying interest rates for another month could exacerbate the situation. Despite the recent cooling inflation and labor data, Dudley believes the Fed should instead cut rates at its next policy meeting. He also noted that macro conditions have worsened, with low consumer savings, decreased housing construction, and waning government-led investing initiatives fading. The three-month average unemployment rate is up 0.43 percentage point from its low point in the prior 12 months, which could trigger a recession, according to Dudley. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that the odds of a July rate cut are only 7% for the Fed, compared to a near-consensus 88% for September.",

The town, which is home to 4,700 residents and draws over two million tourists annually, was evacuated earlier this week due to the threat of two wildfires. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance and is coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance.",

The expansion comes after JetBlue cut some routes in Florida, including eight routes from Fort Lauderdale and a Miami-Los Angeles flight. The biggest additions will be to New England states, with Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in New Hampshire adding daily flights to Orlando and Fort Myers and Fort Lauderdale starting in 2025. Rhode Island's T.F. Greene Airport in Providence will also get winter seasonal flights to Fort Myers, Tampa, and Portland International Jetport in Maine. JetBlue plans to begin flights from Long Island MacArthur Airport daily to Orlando, and four times a week to Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach.",

His death came during a break in depositions in his own whistleblower retaliation suit against Boeing. The revelation comes a month after his family filed a lawsuit against Boeing, holding the company responsible for his death. Barnett had previously warned about sub-standard parts being fitted to aircraft on the assembly line and had issued warnings about the 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max models before his sudden death.",

The Democratic Party has claimed an 'enthusiasm boost' after President Joe Biden stepped aside and Harris took over his campaign. However, some Trump supporters believe this is a ruse. They believe that Democrats are being'really quiet' in the state, where North Carolina is a must-win state for 2024. In 2016, Trump won by 3.6 percent and in 2020, but still beat Biden by 1.3 percent. The Democrat Party plans to double their workforce in the next two weeks and start staffing up six months earlier than in previous election cycles.",

The Department ofNatural Resources (Mille Lac) has reported low walleyer mortality on the lake since the opening of the season began on May 11. The current bag limit allows anglers to keep one walleyed, 21-to-23 inches, starting Aug.16. However, there is speculation that the DNR may extend the bag limit to two walleyes or combine the two-inch harvest slot. The announcement could come as early as Monday evening when DNR fisheries biologists meet with the Mille-Lacs Fisheries Advisory Committee.",

Dickerson was drafted in the second round, 44th overall by the Nationals in the 2024 MLB Draft and signed for $1.7 million above his slot value of $2,122,200. The contract is the most-ever for a drafted outside the first and supplemental first-round period for a non-first-round player, according to MLB.com’s Jim Callis. The old record second-round pool record was $33.5 million, which the Philadelphia Phillies gave Kevin Gowdy in 2016. Dickenson, a shortstop, hit 18 home runs and was named NJ.com Player of Year after helping Morris Knolls win its second consecutive Group 3 championship and stealing 27 bases.",

      "summary": "The Olympic football team has a history of controversy and controversy at the Games, starting with an \"unofficial\" final between Denmark and Greece in 1896, where the referee, Prince George, was a royal in both nations. The North Korean women's team nearly didn't play at all in 2012 due to a mix-up of screens displaying the South Korean flag by mistake before their match against Colombia. In 2016, USA USA USA goalkeeper Hope Solo labelled Sweden \"a bunch of cowards\" for their team's actions in a penalty shootout. The men’s event kicked off amid tight security as Israel faced Mali in Paris, but Argentina and Morocco had different ideas, with Argentina’ Cristian Medina scoring one of the greatest last-minute pinball equalisers ever seen. The game was suspended after full-time was played for three minutes, leading to a pitch invasion and three more minutes of additional time. The women's event will begin later on Thursday as Canada will face New Zealand.",

The event took place six weeks after Macron dissolved parliament after a defeat in European parliamentary elections by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN). The Macron camp had warned that victory for either the RN or the New Popular Front (LFI), which plan to increase public spending and raise corporate taxes, would damage France's economic stability and deter foreign direct investment. However, data from France's statistics office showed that industry morale unexpectedly dropped in July.",

Other products from Ikea include a pumpkin-themed LED table table lamp and Halloween serving bowls. While some retailers are currently selling Halloween-themed serving plates, most are more expensive than Ikea's Kustlyr serving plate, which costs Ikea at $7.99 each. Additionally, the Höstaagille pie plate, measuring 13 inches, has more room to accommodate freshly baked apple and pies.",

A Dallas County jury awarded his family $3.6 million in June, largely due to the negligence of a North Texas trucking company and a truck driver. The lawsuit alleges that the truck stopped due to a mechanical issue and the driver did not deploy flares or triangles to warn oncoming drivers. Despite the trial and jury verdict, a final judgment has not yet been entered. A final hearing is scheduled for August 16. The wrongful death lawsuit was first filed in December 2021 by the family and asked for damages no less than $1 million.",
