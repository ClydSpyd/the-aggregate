The fan took to American social news website reddit to express his concerns about the legality of the practice. While some fans were mixed, others felt that Titmus was given preferential treatment due to the colouring of her nails. There is no rule in place which bans athletes from entering the water with their nails done, nor is there supposed to be a rule against athletes from competing with such nails. While Titmus has been well-received for her performance in the pool, she recently faced criticism for criticising the 'ridiculous' conditions inside the Olympic village.",

Here are some health tips for August, including how to stay fit, exercise like an Olympian, and check your immunization records. Cancer rates in millennials, Gen X-ers have risen sharply in recent years, with younger generations diagnosed with breast, pancreatic, liver and other cancers at higher rates than previous generations. Parents of Olympic athletes are wearing heart rate monitors to monitor their performance. A study suggests semaglutide may help people quit smoking and may help reduce nicotine cravings. Loneliness can be a major concern for older adults, and there are simple ways to stay socially connected. Preteen suicide rates are rising 8% a year, and parents can help parents prevent this increase.",

Fraley had made her financial plight public via a post on social media stating that she couldn't afford her rent due to school sending only 75% of her rent compared to what it pays for football players without a win. Ohanian responded by sending payment out $7,760. The payment was split between the businessman and husband of Serena Williams. Despite the differences in Olympic earnings depending on the medals earned, Team USA pays $37,500 for a gold medal, $22,500, and $15,000 for a bronze medal.",

Edwards is now sober after entering rehab for a serious drug addiction, which put strain on his and Maci's co-parenting relationship.

He and his wife, Luciana Barroso, share three daughters: Isabella, 18, Gia, 16, and Stella, 13. Damon also serves as stepfather to Alexia, 25, whom he and Luciana, 48, shares with her ex-husband Arbello Barosso. Despite most of Damon's daughters being old enough to date, Damon has a positive attitude towards their boyfriends.",

The former glamour model, who purchased the property in 2014, had previously been evicted from the property during her bankruptcy and has since moved into a new £5,000 per month home. Despite this, Katie insisted that it was her choice to leave the premises and warned that the mansion is cursed. She also revealed that someone had previously broken into her property and sprayed a corrosive substance over her Range Rover. The property is currently in need of some repairs, with photos showing damage to its outside walls and marks in the kitchen from where cupboards have been pulled out.",

The scheme, run by Wessex Archaeology, was overseen by Phil Harding, former Time Team presenter. The BBC was given exclusive access to the dig and spoke to two of the prisoners, both serving long sentences for violent crimes. The project was funded by the National Lottery’s Heritage Fund and was the idea of Wessex archaeology. It is hoped that this initiative will help offenders re-offend after being released, as over a third of prisoners re-enter society with criminal activities.",

Despite not being financially flourishing, accounts filed in October 2023 showed it had just £149 in assets. Willoughy's own lifestyle brand launched in 2021 and currently sells candles, style advice, and a section on spirituality where readers are advised on crystals, healing and auras. She almost launched a lifestyle website with former pal, Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, in 2018 with Holly as its face.",

Despite having assets of £585,633 and owing creditors £583,748, the company is only just staying in the black. The brand, which sells exotic candles and perfume, has been compared to Goop. Despite not being financially flourishing, accounts filed in October 2023 showed it had just £149 in assets. Holly launched her lifestyle brand in 2021 and it currently sells candles, style advice, and a section on spirituality. She almost launched a lifestyle website with former pal, Peter Jones, in 2018 with Holly as its face.",

      "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's plan to deport all migrants unlawfully in the U.S. could result in a reduction in the agricultural labor force and severely impact America's dairy industry. Nearly half of agricultural workers in the US are undocumented immigrants, and 45 percent of all agricultural workers are \"unauthorized\" migrants working illegally on American farms and ranches. Immigrant labor accounts for 51% of all dairy labor, and dairies that employ immigrant labor produce 79% of the US milk supply. This could significantly impact the dairy industry in Wisconsin and California, particularly as 70% of labor on Wisconsin's dairy farms is carried out by over 10,000 undocumented migrant workers. The deportation policy could sway voters toward Vice President Kamala Harris, who would beat Trump in Wisconsin by two points.",

The meeting included tribal elders, civilian and security officials, and a temporary ceasefire was agreed upon. No casualties have been reported since then and the government is confident of resolving the conflict. The conflict began over a land dispute between Shia-majority and Sunni-majority tribes, which has led to fighting in the past. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has urged the government to broker peace in the area, stating that all disputes over land or sectarian conflict must be resolved peacefully through negotiations convened by the KP government.",

      "summary": "UK temperatures are expected to reach 30C (86F) today, with temperatures expected to rise to around 25C (77F) across many parts of the UK, with slightly lower highs expected to continue rising into next week. This comes after almost a month's worth of rain fell in an hour last night, with New Addington in South London seeing the heaviest downpour of 53mm (2.1in) of rain, the equivalent rainfall for the month of August in the same area. The Environment Agency has issued 26 flood alerts across England this morning, including 11 in the outskirts of Greater London. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said that while there will still be some heavy showers across the far East of England at first, these will largely clear before more showers develop across eastern England into the afternoon, along with thunder. However, he warned that a system moving in from the North West could bring increasing cloud and outbreaks of rain which could be heavy across parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the far North and West of England and Wales.",

This has led to a decrease in contact with my family, including my aunts and cousins who no longer invite me to family events.

      "summary": "The rapid and ongoing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been a key driver of the market rebound, with some high-profile names losing ground recently. However, recent developments have seen some high profile names losing their share due to the slow adoption of AI technology. This gives savvy investors an opportunity to invest in companies that still have room to grow in the AI market. Among the notable names are Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), which has a long history of developing AI tools for the U.S. government and its allies and expanded its mandate to help businesses discover actionable intelligence from corporate data, and Palantar's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps provide common sense solutions to everyday business problems. Despite this, most experts believe that we're still in the early stages of AI adoption. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, could see significant growth as a result of its high-end server manufacturer. The company's revenue surged 200% year over year to roughly $3.8 billion and its diluted earnings per share soared 329% to $6.56.",

Research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has found that British employment laws are significantly weaker than those in other major economies, according to the TUC. The study also revealed that labour laws were half as protective as those in France and significantly weaker as Spain, Italy, and Germany. The TUC's general secretary, Paul Nowak, called for the Government's Employment Rights Bill within the first 100 days of the term. The proposed measures include increasing the minimum wage and banning “fire and rehire” practices. However, concerns have been raised about an increase in unfair dismissal complaints and a system that mirrors the strict labour laws in France.",

This decision has sparked political crisis in Venezuela, with Maduro's victory exceeding pre-election polls and drawing global criticism. Machado maintains her claim that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia was the rightful winner, based on tallies obtained from most of the nation's polling stations. The government-aligned National Electoral Council declared that Maduro won with 51% of the vote. The United States and the European Union have demanded Venezuelan authorities release detailed voting data. At least 20 people have died in protests after the election, while over 1,000 have been jailed. Venezuela has also withdrawn diplomats from eight critical Latin American countries and asked envoys from those nations to leave its territory.",

The company's cash and cash equivalents balance, which Buffett invests almost all of it in short-term Treasury bonds, is expected to exceed $200 billion in value when Berkshire reports its second-quarter earnings. This comes as Buffett has sold more equities than he bought for six consecutive quarters, including two consecutive quarters of selling Apple shares. This could make it eight quarters in a row. Berkshire Hathway's Treasury holdings have grown from $109 billion in 2022 to $189 billion 18 months later. Despite this, Buffett has warned that the Treasury holdings are probably overkill and suggests it's increasingly difficult to find a good investment opportunity regardless of the size of your portfolio.",

This follows a sharp drop in the small-cap Russell 2000 index and chip designer Nvidia's slump from record highs. Analysts from Deutsche Bank highlighted weak earnings from Amazon and suggested that investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will intervene to boost economic growth. Intel, the US chip manufacturer, reported unexpectedly weak earnings and plans to cut 15% of its workforce, potentially resulting in a loss of over 17,500 jobs globally.",

This comes after a previous surgery in May to repair the meniscon, and Trout had been working towards a return before his rehab was shut down. Despite batting.220 with 10 homers and 14 RBIs in 29 games for the Angels this season, Trout has been limited by a series of injuries over the past four years. He hasn't played more than 119 games in any of the past five seasons. Trout is making $37.1m in the sixth year of a 12-year, $426.5m contract and will earn that salary in each of the next six seasons.",

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported 147mm of rain, breaking a 14-year record for the highest single day total in July. This caused infrastructure damage in northern India as widespread waterlogging led to flash floods. In Kerala, landslides were triggered, with an estimated 572mm of rainfall falling in 48 hours. At least 194 people have been killed and over 8,300 people are relocated to government-run relief camps. The IMD has issued weather warnings for the remainder of this week for isolated and extremely heavy rain, their highest rainfall threshold. Some schools and offices will remain closed due to the potential for further flooding. The Paris Olympics have seen temperatures rise, affecting spectators and athletes, and some sports have had to change their rules to ensure safety.",

Following this sale, Berkshire Hathaway still holds a significant 11.54% position in its portfolio, down from 12.15%. This move could signal a strategic shift or rebalancing of Berkshire's vast portfolio, which remains heavily invested in major corporations across various sectors. The financial sector continues to be a significant component of the global economy and its performance is seen as a bellwether for broader economic conditions. Despite this, the recent sale by Buffett could potentially cause short-term volatility in BAC's stock price.",

Jones entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors regarding the treatment of two inmates at the Walker County jail. He also pleaded guilty to another rights-deprivation count related to assault of another inmate. The plea agreement indicated there were five co-conspirators involved in the mistreatment of Mitchell, indicating that the investigation is ongoing and more people could be charged in the death. Mitchell died on Jan. 26, 2023, after being brought from the jail to a hospital emergency room with a body temperature of 72 degrees.",

However, \"we don’t need as much protein as many people believe,\" according to registered dietician Braeden Yacobucci, a dietician at OnPoint Nutrition in Philadelphia. Yacobinucci noted that 65 grams of protein per day is roughly 10 ounces of animal protein, compared to approximately 10 ounces per day for a chicken thigh. Doctor-ordered tests can confirm if you are eating enough protein. Early protein deficiency symptoms include fatigue, weakened immune system, fatigue, and a decreased sleep-deprivedness. Additionally, fiber could also be a factor, as well as not getting enough fiber.",

      "summary": "The one thing to avoid from hydroplaning is to panic and stop your car from re-establish traction, according to Mike Thomas, a driving instructor for 27 years and co-founder of AllGood Driving School in Northern California. This position is described as \"like being a boat,\" as the tires are completely not in contact with the asphalt and the car's position is dependent on the position it takes. There is little to do until the tires regain traction, so avoid being in this position. The most common mistake is to slam the brakes, which can cause the car to lurch to the left or right. There are several steps to reduce hydroplans, including extra caution in the beginning of storms and slow down in flood conditions.",

Despite its lack of emotional impact, the film is praised for its engaging presentation of science and its portrayal of the right use of scientific breakthroughs in the right hands. Despite some difficulty, it is said to be an absorbing experience for general viewers.",

      "summary": "The aftermath of college protests, which resulted in thousands of arrests this spring, has impacted students' academic careers. Some 3,200 people were arrested during a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments protesting the war in Gaza. While many have already seen their charges dismissed, cases have yet to be resolved for hundreds of people at campuses with the highest number of arrests. In St. Louis, Valencia Alvarez is awaiting potential charges for a protest at Washington University, where 23 of the arrested students were students. The University of New York at New Paltz has asked judges to dismiss 129 cases stemming from arrests at the State University New York. Students have criticized college leaders' decisions to invite police into their gates, claiming they trampled peaceful demonstrations with unnecessary levels of force.",

The focus is on the main character, Sandy Cheek, a scientist from Texas who came undersea to do research. However, the film underdelivers on its promise by introducing several new characters, including Sandy's entire family, who are one-note and are stereotypical Southern archetypes instead of fleshed-out characters. The script is criticized for not fully committing to the gonzo madness required for a movie like this, particularly by villain Sue Nahmee, played by Wanda Sykes. The animation style for the movie was criticized for being overly smooth and unhelpful. The film's animation was criticized by some for blending live action with live-action worlds, and it all takes a few minutes to adjust to the medium.",

      "summary": "Israel eliminated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah second-in-command Fu’ad Shukr, two of its key enemies, in a controversial move that the media misconstrued. Analysts on CNN and BBC predicted an \"escalation\" of hostilities within the region, but it is possible that these deaths may prevent a wider war. Israel's elimination of Haniyah in Tehran, Tehran, and Beirut indicated that Israel could send a signal to the Aytollahs and their internal opponents that the regime cannot defend itself. The murder of 12 Druze Arab children in Majdal Shams by a Hezbollah rocket also helped Israel reinforce a sense of national unity. However, critics argue that Israel's actions violate the idea of a unit of \"replacement theology\", which was supplanted by Jewish connection to God.",

      "summary": "Summer foot problems may be due to the summer, when soft tissue issues in the feet are exacerbated by excessive footwear. Podiatrist Dr. Ebonie Vincent, who appears on the TLC show \"My Feet Are Killing Me,\" suggests that long summer walks can lead to months of foot pain. While a comfy fit is fine, too much roominess can cause problems due to too large shoes. Shoes that are too large can cause as much trouble and problems as shoes that are small. Podiatricist Marion Yau warns against buying sandals that rub against any part of your skin, which could cause blisters and potential infection. There are exercises to strengthen your feet for sandal season and how often should you replace your shoes.",

Mountain gorillas are found in Volcanoes national park, Rwanda, and the global population is confined to two patches of Afromontane forest. After years of advocacy, Charley, a 43-year-old African elephant at National Zoological Garden in Pretoria, South Africa, is set to retire at the Shambala private game reserve. Other wildlife featured include a marine iguanas, a rare breed from the Galápagos, which feeds directly from the Pacific, making it a good indicator of ocean health. An Asian golden cat is released back into the wild after being injured by a poacher in Indonesia.",

The non-greasy, quickly absorbed body lotion was praised for its ability to moisturise and sloughed off dead, flaky grey skin. The result resulted in soft, smooth limbs and a reduction in upper arm bumps. Soap and Glory's Sugar Crush body Lotion was a summer essential. The author shares her recommendations for new exfoliating lotions, particularly for those with sensitive or teenage skin. She also recommends British brand Q+A’�s Salicylic Acid Smoothing Lotion for bumpy arms, as beta-hydroxy acids are better against clogged-up pores than their alpha counterparts in Dove lotion.",

The report also warned of an average of 40 rape victims a day in some areas of the capital. Armed gangs have controlled most of the Haitian capital since former president Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021. The UN's office in Port-au-Prince reported that while casualties have decreased in recent months, recruitment of children and sexual violence is increasing. The Haitian prime minister, Garry Conille, has pledged to use the 400 Kenyan police officers to retake control of the country \"house by house\".",

      "summary": "The UK's far right wing, following the Southport riots, are gaining a voice in parliament following allegations of inciting violence. The author argues that the riots were not in their name but in an attempt to support those suffering from the loss of three little girls at a summer holiday dance class. They also suggest that civic pride and other old-fashioned values the far right falsely claims to stand for, such as looking after the victims of an unspeakable tragedy, are not an excuse to loot corner shops. Despite questions about whether anything could have been done to prevent the riots, Keir Starmer has committed to swift justice for those directly guilty of violence and for any group actively orchestrating it. However, the author suggests that while there are still concerns about knife crime, the rioters may have a point to take seriously about immigration or knife crime. The article also suggests that broadcasters and social media platforms should produce clear plans to counterbalance social media plans for more unrest.",

He claims his security detail couldn't get licenses to carry guns on the evening of Shakur’s death due to a complacent Death Row felt “too safe” in Las Vegas due to Suge Knight’�s ownership of a nightclub nearby. However, Wright Jr has faced criticism for his decisions regarding the death of Tupac. The article discusses the dangers of the rap industry for bodyguards, who must manage threats from rivals and keep rappers safe from extortion, armed robbery attempts, and even aggrieved fans. Notable US rappers have often been murdered or assaulted due to gang violence since the mid-1990s.",

The article suggests that while Phil and Marissa moved into a new flat with a private garden with a patio door and an alleyway only the owners have the key for, the issue is a safety issue as Marissa is a year old. The author expresses concern over allowing strangers into the garden while Marissa's mother, Patricia, is a traditional \"mi casa es su casa\" person and is not particularly fond of the idea of communal living. Patricia disagrees with this idea, stating that Patricia dislikes the possibility of people being in the garden at the same time as her, but could stipulate that they can only use it when they're out. The writer expresses concern that this could lead to a disagreement with Patricia, who is more cautious about allowing strangers in the building to use their garden.",

The AS700 flew above tourist attractions at a speed of 60km/h and an altitude of 500 metres (1,640 feet) for about two hours. Its manufacturer, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic), said the speed and flight altitude allowed tourists to enjoy a high level of stability and security. The airship can travel uninterrupted for 10 hours and can hold up to nine passengers to reach its maximum 700km range and flight time. It is also expected to be used in logistics, intelligent topography, emergency rescue, anti-terrorism tasks and security control. Avic has had 20 orders for the airship from domestic travel agencies and tourist attractions, with the first aircraft set to be delivered by the end of the year.",

      "summary": "Katie Price's holidays abroad have often been marred by controversy and unfortunate incidents. The former glamour model, who was declared bankrupt for a second time in March, has been issued with an arrest warrant after she skipped a court appearance due to a £760,000 unpaid tax bill. Despite claiming she was not on the run, she insisted that she was filming a documentary to meet these orders. It was later revealed that she is planning on having £10,000 worth of surgeries on her eyes and under her chin in Istanbul. In 2013, a heavily pregnant Katie was left terrified when her waters broke prematurely at 32 weeks while on holiday in France with her then-husband, Kieran Hayler, and later named her son Jett Riviera. In 2019, Katie stirred up controversy when she was spotted out on holiday with builder Charles Drury in Turkey with whom she was engaged. She became wheelchair-bound after falling 20ft into an underground car park and breaking her feet. In 2022, she broke her feet in Turkey after a horror accident following a drunken night out.",

      "summary": "A reader responds to a letter by a New York Voicer, Lloyd Litwak, who questioned why the world is so focused on Israel as compared to other murderous regimes such as other countries who have forced populations to become refugees and destroy their enemies' schools, hospitals, electricity, communications, water treatment and food delivery, while others have displaced the same people over and over. Litwaks also denies that the children of Gaza are innocent, as their parents voted for Hamas. He fails to consider whether the Israeli goal of finding every last Hamas fighter on Earth is legitimate, and whether Hamas is already defeated and incapable of invading Israel again. The reader suggests that while others support Israel, they also support other countries that have committed war crimes, they question their moral judgment. The author also criticizes the media's focus on the Olympics for focusing on Israel's involvement in the Summer Olympics, which has been overshadowed by other countries' involvement.",

Tolkien was a professor of Anglo-Saxon and English at Oxford University from 1925 to 1959 and a religious conservative. Critics argue that the saga is deeply religious and represents no ideology or faction of fans.",

The article suggests that all digital services, programs, and activities, both public and private, should be accessible. It also suggests that the Department of Education should integrate digital accessibility into courses and professional development programs and establish a process to ensure regulations keep pace with technological advancements. The authors also advocate for comprehensive mandatory digital accessibility regulations. They argue that this is about creating a more inclusive and equitable society, rather than compliance.",

However, seven players are competing in Paris, having all earned substantial sums since joining the Saudi-backed tour.

The show's central conflict is between Harper Stern (Myha’la) and her mentor, Eric Tao (Ken Leung), a Type A industry veteran in the midst of a midlife crisis. The new season follows a transition between Harper and Eric, with Harper's position at Pierpoint becoming a lowly employee and Yasmin Kara-Hanani's former co-worker. The creators, Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, have combined each character's storyline with a trenchant critique of capitalism. The season opens on the eve of an IPO that Pierpoint has been managing for a green energy startup.",

Find out about major issues and consider how these changes will affect your life before deciding on what to do. Focus on tasks behind the scenes to achieve your aims and find answers to questions about a situation someone has been keeping from you. Consider carefully how some changes will impact your life and whether it is time to consider another job, or train for a new line of work, or to improve yourself in your existing area. Observers notice that trust in high-ranking individuals has decreased recently due to declining trust in them.

The benchmark index contains stocks from 500 of the largest companies in the US, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Investing in the S&M 500 can be a great way to diversify your portfolio with minimal effort and is a much better chance this type of investment will recover from market downturns. However, while market slumps are inevitable, they are usually shorter than bull markets. Investors should ignore short-term fluctuations and stay invested over the long haul, as long as possible.",

The brand emphasised the importance of socialising, with a study finding that 24% of the global population feels lonely and 6% do not feel connected to others. The ad, created by creative agency LePubis, shows that Heineken's focus is on socialising rather than the beer itself. The campaign also includes a 'Good Times Index' to help consumers experience good times at parties, football matches, or bar parties. The full ad is available on the internet.",

Many believe Ukraine should aim for survival as a sovereign nation, while others argue for Russia's defeat. This has led to a mixed policy of arming Ukraine with enough to survive but not enough to win. As things stand, a protracted stalemate or defeat seems the most likely outcome. Francis Dearnley, The Telegraph's assistant comment editor and co-presenter of Ukraine: The Latest, analyses five factors that could transform Ukraine's fortunes.",

Napoli has an offer of 12m euros for 23-year old Brighton and Scotland midfielder Billy Gilmour, but are waiting for players to leave the club before making it.

The word was coined by former Republican president George W. Bush after Donald Trump's first day as president, during which he delivered the most dystopian inaugural address ever. The use of the word 'weird' is seen as a sign of resistance to the criticism of Donald Trump, who has previously been labelled as authoritarian, racist, a threat to democracy, a liar, and a convicted felon. However, the term has been revived for this political moment as a counterpunch to \"woke,\" which remains intact unlike Republicans' dog-whistle perversion of the term.",

The Australian government found that serious errors led to the airstrike, including a lack of Israeli Defence Forces procedures, mistaken identification, and errors in decision-making. Former Australian Defence Force chief Mark Binskin served as special adviser to the government on Israel's response to the incident, stating that the strike was not deliberately directed towards the WCK. The deaths were the result of serious failures to follow Israeli defence Force procedures and a misidentification compounded by confirmation bias. Two Israeli officers have been removed and three reprimanded, but Frankcom's family has called for a criminal investigation. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong stated that Israel will implement all recommendations and reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.",

The retractable roof was supposed to be on during the evening's competition but it appeared to have multiple areas that allowed water to pass. This was exacerbated by a large storm over the stadium, which exposed the leaks. Footage emerged on social media showing the heavy rain coming into the arena and fans trying to cover themselves. The Eiffel Tower Stadium was evacuated due to heavy rain, and the Eiffle Tower Stadium in Paris was evacuated.",
