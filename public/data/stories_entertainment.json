      "summary": "The Broadwick Soho, London's newest designer hotel and celebrity haunt, was conceived by hotel owner Noel Hayden and Managing Director Jo Ringestad. The hotel, which opened less than a year ago, was the brainchild of Hayden's childhood owner, Noel Sr., a former circus performer, and mother Jackie, who owned a successful 120-room seaside hotel in Bournemouth, England. The loss of the hotel was devastating for Hayden, but his desire to own his own hotel inspired him to create an opulent contemporary retreat. Hayden enlisted internationally acclaimed interior designer Martin Brudnizki to design the hotel, and the results are remarkable. The Broadwick showcases British eccentricity and maximalism, including handcrafted Murano mirrors and lamps from Italy and a variety of fabrics and materials.",

Eva, who is a mother to three children, explained that she had chosen the gown to'show her figure' and celebrate herself as a woman. She shared the comments on her blog, Happily Eva After, and admitted that the intense hate made her cry. She theorized that the hate came down to self-loathing and rage.",

Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles for $26 million guaranteed and $37.75 million overall, making him the highest-paid running back in franchise history. The show's coverage of Barkley's departure was part of a series detailing his departure from the Giants after six seasons.

The Sovereign Grant accounts reveal that the royal couple spent $1 million on Charles' coronation celebrations last year, while the energy crisis in 2023 led to Buckingham Palace's electricity bill soaring by $1.3 million.

However, viewing on terrestrial television in the UK is limited due to the BBC's limited coverage being split across two live streams. For comprehensive live coverage, subscribers will need to subscribe to Discovery+, which offers a special Olympics offer for £3.99 per month. The main European rights holder for the Olympics is Warner Bros Discovery, which also co-owns TNT Sport. BBC One and BBC Two will cover British athletes and broadcast the biggest events, but the BBC can broadcast a maximum of two live stream of action at any one time.",

Vance for his stance on women who do not have children, stating that America is being run by a group of \"childless cat ladies\" to its detriment. This statement was made in response to a Fox News clip showing Vance's claim that the country is being led by these \"childlessness cat ladies\". Aniston expressed her disappointment in this statement on Instagram. Vance was part of a group who blocked protections for IVF treatments in June, a move that has become a hot political issue as reproductive rights become a priority. Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic pick for the 2024 election, also criticized Vance's stance on IVF.",

She shared birthday tributes on her Insta Stories, showing a framed photo with Affleck from her 2022 wedding. This comes after Lopez celebrated her 55th birthday with a massive party and a swimsuit photo. The last time they were seen together was in early June at his son Samuel's basketball game. Despite this, Lopez has been seen with Ben's eldest daughter, Violet, and their Bel Air mansion is currently on the market for $68M. There are claims that neither Lopez nor Affleck have filed for divorce but are quietly working out their relationship behind the scenes to resolve issues.",

      "summary": "The revival of Charles Dickens' classic musical, Oliver!, has been reviewed by the Guardian for its timelessness and exquisite performances. The production, adapted from Dickens, features a score of Lionel Bart's songs and performances by Matthew Bourne, Matthew Bourse, Jean-Pierre van der Spuy, and Lez Brotherston. Despite the artistic excellence and musical performances, it feels safe, tame and nostalgic. Simon Lipkin plays Fagin, playing Fagin as a Jewish character who reflects his Jewish heritage, and Cian Eagle-Service plays the role of Oliver. Despite this, the production does acknowledge the problematic character of Fagin. The review concludes that the show could be renamed Fagin!",

The publisher announced that over 600,000 copies of the book have been sold since Trump's announcement on July 15. The book, which tells of Vance's childhood in Ohio and his family's roots in rural Kentucky, was widely cited as essential reading for understanding Trump's appeal to working class whites after his victory in 2016. Despite criticism, the book has been adapted into a feature film.",

The photos show her posing in a bikini and showing off her toned waistline and taut abs, highlighting her ample cleavage in a black bikini. Despite her denial of having undergone plastic surgery, plastic surgeons have expressed their belief that the actress has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery. Dr. Elie Levine, a NYC-based surgeon, stated that Erin's appearance appeared to have been augmented and her brow position appears as good as it did a decade ago. Meanwhile, Dr. Deniz Sarhaddi, a Missouri-based dermatologist, suspected that Erin had a nose job and has reportedly spent anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 on cosmetic surgery alone.",

Daniel Kessler, Paul Banks, and AdamJosephByrne, who have been together for 20 years, discuss their appreciation of the connection between their music and their audience. They also share their fondest memories from recording or touring Antics, which had leaked and fans in Spain came up to them talking about it. The band was concerned about losing respect for their song \"Untitled\" in Friends, but avoided certain commercial licences to avoid potentially undermining their legitimacy. They have also shared memories of being stranded on the bus during a tour in 2014, including being stuck outside Buffalo for days.",

Anne Hathaway's role in The Idea of You, which had 50 million viewers in its first two weeks on Prime Video, has led Us Weekly to declare that the age gap is back. A study revealed that 81 percent of women are open to dating someone 10 years younger, while 90 percent of men are looking for someone a decade older. The change is attributed to women being more focused on their professional success than finding a man to take care of them. Celebrities like Cher and Kristin Cavallari, who have a 13-year age gap with their boyfriend, are also embracing this trend.",

The loss comes as the league secured a $77 billion deal with Disney, Comcast, and Amazon. Warner Bros. has been broadcasting NBA games on its TNT network since 1989 and reportedly pays $1.2 billion annually for the rights. This loss will impact TNT's NBA-adjacent content, such as \"Inside the NBA.\" Warner Bros.'s statement stated that it had matched Amazon's media rights bid to continue airing NBA games, but the league rejected the offer. The company plans to sue the NBA for violating its contractual rights to air NBA games.",

The announcement is expected to provide a fresh topic of conversation away from the ongoing scandal, which saw Giovanni Pernice, 33, quit earlier this year. This comes as he is under investigation by the BBC over misconduct allegations against several former celebrity dance partners, including his 2023 partner Amanda Abbington. Other potential sign-ups include DIY SOS host Nick Knowles and YouTuber GK Barry. Despite reports of a struggle to get contestants, production has confirmed that all cast members have signed up for this year and are eager to make the announcement sooner rather than later. The speculation comes after Strictly Come Dancing's professional dancers returned to rehearsals.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump's obsession with Hannibal Lecter, the late great character from Silence of the Lambs, has led to speculation that he may replace his running mate, JD Vance. During a rally in North Carolina, Trump mentioned Lecter as his next VP. This reference has been made numerous times throughout the campaign, with many believing it is related to the term'mental asylum' and \"asylum seeker\". These theories suggest that Trump may confuse the definition of asylum and mistakenly believe all immigrants seeking asylum are automatically insane. However, it is unclear whether Trump believes Lecter is alive or not. The use of the phrase \"the late, great Hannibal Lecters\" suggests that he might be unable to distinguish fiction from reality.",

Massey had called 911 earlier that night to report a potential intruder. One of the responding officers, Deputy Sean Grayson, had asked Massey to remove a pot of hot water from the stove while inside her home and threatened to shoot her in the face if it was accidental. Grayson then fired three shots at Massey three times. The deputy was later terminated from his position and is facing five counts of aggravated battery, official misconduct, and three counts of first degree murder. His pre-trial release has been granted.",

This changed after Tyson was accused of exchanging inappropriate messages with minors, though the full scope of these allegations remains under investigation. Beast has issued his own statement, stating that he took immediate action to remove Tyson from the company, his channel, and any association with MrBeast, while Tyson stated that it was a mutually decided decision and that she would step away.

She was given an appreciation for the impact of natural diamonds on sustainable development for host communities in both countries. In South Africa, she visited De Beer's world-class Venetia diamond mine and the 32,000 hectare Venetian Limpopo Nature Reserve adjacent to the mine, which provides protected habitat for threatened and endangered species. In Namibia, she also visited the NDTC (Namibian Diamond Trading Company) and Namdeb, both 50:50 joint ventures between the Namibian Government and Debeers, a 50% joint venture between the government and the company. She also attended a gala dinner attended by the Minister in the Office of the Presidency and high-ranking business leaders. During her visit, she was presented with a courtesy visit to the Namibia President, Dr Nangolo Mbumba, who praised her efforts to demonstrate the positive contribution that natural diamonds make to the country's economy.",

The decision may have been one of her best career moves, as she had faith in the film and its success. Dern initially asked the heads of the film, psychology, and film department heads for a leave of absence, but they declined. She also offered to send school work via mail or \"double up classes\" in an effort to convince them otherwise. Despite this, Dern's role in David Lynch's film \"blue Velvet\" led to a wide-ranging acting career.",

Some fans believe that she already indicated her support for Harris during an Eras Tour concert in Hamburg, Germany, during which she played a mashup of her songs \"Last Great American Dynasty\" and \"Run\" during the event. While her team did not respond to a request for comment, it is common for Swift to fuse two songs together in a final thought. Jake Deyton, a TikTok influencer, is backing the presumptive Democratic nominee and suggested in a video that Harris should use her marketing skills to help her campaign. However, some Swifties believe that Taylor should empower her fans to vote for whoever aligns with their beliefs, values, opinions and morals.",

The NBA had announced new agreements with Walt Disney's (DIS.N) ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal and Amazon.com in an 11-year deal worth $77 billion. Warner Bros Discovery's shares fell more than 7% in early trading as Macquarie Equity Research downgraded the stock to neutral due to the loss of NBA rights. Some analysts have suggested that the lawsuit could harm Warner's competitiveness in the long run as other leagues may become hesitant to sign deals with them.",

      "summary": "The author of Halle Butler's Banal Nightmare, author, has become a prominent example of millennials who use therapy lingo to label themselves as \"narcissists\" and \"self-regulation\" as a means of enforcing unwritten social codes. The author's novels, like those of Margaret \"Moddie\" Yance and Jillian, often depict members of their generation's tendency to psychologically chase their own tails. The novel, which is primarily about Margaret \"moddie,\" Yance, an unemployed 30-something who avoids social groups and avoids social attention. The writer argues that self-regulation and avoidance of judgment can be used to exempt your own behavior from scrutiny. Despite this, a greater openness to talking about mental health has its benefits, as well as potential relief and clarity in social media accounts promoting self-care.",

However, the tribunal dismissed these claims, stating that Willy is a common abbreviation for William and Aylmers did not have a genuine belief that McGinty's first name constituted sexual harassment. The tribunal also accepted that McGinny had always been known as Willy, as his father and grandfather had been.",

The show debuted at #1 on Netflix's Top 10 list but was replaced by another show. The replacement is a three-hour series about the alleged scam of Backstreet boys and N'Sync. The release date for Part 2 of the second part of the final season is November, four months from now, and the third part is some time in 2025. This is part of a trend of Netflix breaking up its popular shows into three parts due to its desire to streamline them into smaller batches of episodes rather than two. Other popular shows include All American at #3 and Too Hot to Handle at No.10.",

Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, for his comments about women like Kamala Harris, who he compared to \"childless cat ladies\" on a 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson's old Fox News show. In the video, Vance stated that the future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. Aniston shared a screenshot of the clip to her Instagram Story and also criticized Vance's extreme stance on reproductive rights. Since the video surfaced, Vance has faced criticism from commentators who disagree with his remarks and noted that Harris is a parent.",

Discovery fell 8% at the open of the day following the NBA's announcement of three major rights deals with three WBD rivals, effectively eliminating the company from professional basketball. This has led some Wall Street analysts to suggest that the company should split or merge, following the Warner Media-Discovery deal. The loss of these key rights means Discovery loses a core content asset for both its linear networks and its Max streaming service. Tim Nollen of Macquarie Equity Research downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “outperform” and stated that while the shares are cheap already, they don’t see a good fundamental investment case now. WBD has threatened to take “appropriate action\" against the NBA, indicating it plans to litigate the decision.",

The Duchess of Sussex later dismissed the interview as an \"orchestrated reality show\", a claim made in her Netflix docu-series, Harry & Meghan, which first aired in 2022. Richard Eden, writing in the Daily Mail, highlighted possible discrepancies in the couple's story, including Meghan telling Husain she met Prince Harry on a blind date, while the Duke said they met over Instagram.",

The fragrance house's latest partner in crime is Orange Marmalade, a zesty hit of orange, which is the perfect fresh summer scent. The collaboration with John Lewis saw searches for \"Paddington bear\" on the website increase by 128% since the launch of the collaboration, and sales of the PADDington Bear Collector Bear have increased by 250% since its launch. The perfume itself is also flying off shelves, becoming the second most searched for beauty product on the John Lewis website since it launched and has had a knock-on effect across the brand's fragrances, boosting sales by 42% across the board. Other top ten picks include Orange Crush, a body mist created by perfumer Jo Malone herself, and Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540.",

She explained that the two were supposed to clink glasses but the scene ended up being improvised. The actress said it just felt right to improvise the embrace. Helen has also landed a new role in Gladstone Girls, a six-part scripted podcast series, and will have a hand in the writing of the series.",

Pipen, 50, stated that she feels good about her situation and is focused on spending her summer with family and friends. The couple, son of basketball legend Michael Jordan, began dating in September 2022 and made their Instagram official in January 2023. Despite some criticism from Marcus' father, Michael, who shares a basketball rivalry with Larsa's ex-husband, Scottie Pippens, about the couple's relationship, Larsa admitted to feeling \"embarrassed\" and \"traumatized\" by Michael's comments. Despite the break-ups, the two sparked engagement rumors after Marcus gave Larsa a promise ring and revealed they were looking for a wedding venue.",

The injuries sustained the father and daughter at the Ariana Grande concert in May 2017, with Hibbert left with a spinal cord injury and Miss Hibbert with severe brain damage. Hall has claimed that his actions were in the public interest as a journalist and that millions of people have bought a lie about the attack. After a three-and-a-half-day trial, Mrs Justice Steyn said she would give her decision on the claim in writing at a later date.",

The film follows the story of two kids, Owen (a haunting Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), who first met in 1996 and their relationship with a supernatural TV show called The Pink Opaque. Despite critics comparing the show to The Vampire Slayer and Twin Peaks, I Saw The TV Glow is considered powerful and engaging. It is in cinemas from 26 July.",

Harry has ongoing cases against two other tabloid publishers over claims they used unlawful means for stories about him, although he dropped a libel case against the Mail earlier this year. He lost a lawsuit against the government's decision to grant him security protection when in the UK, but was cleared in court in January.",
