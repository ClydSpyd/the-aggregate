The grant will be used to expand the program, which has significantly reduced the amount of food waste sent to the landfill. The program, launched in 2023, has been highly successful and has diverted 33.65 tons of food from the Seneca Meadows Landfill. The cost of disposing of food scraps costs $20 per ton per ton, compared to $115 per ton for disposing solid waste, reduces carbon emissions and reduces waste by fewer truck trips to the Senec landfill. With the grant, Kingston will implement a five-pronged organics diversion program.",

The group quantified these declines through extensive research, including 85 scuba dives, two dozen drone surveys, and analysis of aerial surveys and underwater surveys conducted by the state and several nonprofits. The kelp canopy declined by more than two-thirds between 2010 and 2022, with nearly 900 acres of kelp covering the equivalent of 680 football fields. The decreases occurred in reefs that historically were home to some of Oregon's most notable underwater forests. Researchers are now looking for ways to restore Oregon's kelp ecosystem, with the best hope being reintroducing sea stars back into the ecosystem.",

These conditions have led to increased short-term respiratory complaints and increased risk of stroke and heart attacks, according to Dr. Anthony Gerber, a professor of medicine and director of pulmonary research at National Jewish Health. The issue has been exacerbated by wildfires, wildfires in the Western US and Canada, leading to high ozone levels and challenges in reducing emissions from automobiles and power plants.

      "summary": "Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential race, recently held a rally in North Carolina where he focused on Vice President Kamala Harris, who he claimed should not even be allowed to run for president due to her alleged crimes. This comment was particularly notable as a reference to a jury verdict of nearly three dozen felonies. The comments were part of an attempt to counterbalance the criticism of former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race. This comes as part of a broader trend of suggesting that those who stand in his way are ineligible for American ballots should not be able to run. Despite this, Trump has a reputation for being anti-democracy and has previously stated that Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Joe Biden shouldn't have been \"allowed\" to run against him.",

The study, led by Vincent Gauci, found that tree bark absorbs more methane than soil, the only other known natural sink on Earth. The findings were made over a decade, with researchers measuring methane from trees in countries such as Brazil, Peru, Panama, the UK, and Sweden. They found that while trees emit a little bit of methane at the bottom of their tree, they absorb more at the top of their trunk. The researchers also found that if all tree bark were laid flat, it could cover Earth's land surface and remove between 25 million tons and 50 million tons of methane.",

The oldest company in the UK, the Royal Mint, has been producing coins for over 1,100 years. Instead of producing its own coins from raw steel, the Mint will import 'blanks' from abroad when stocks are low. It will only imprint these blanks at its site in Llantrisant rather than making them from scratch. This comes as Treasury has no new orders for one and two pence coins this year due to a decline in cash use. The Royal Mint will still supply the UK market and is seeking to sell its facilities to produce coin blanks. As part of the shift towards gold recovery, 200 staff have been offered positions in the gold recycling plant.",

The trust sees small, local groups as modern versions of organizations that scholars have highlighted as a distinguishing feature of American democracy. The Trust announced $8 million in funding, the first installment of investments of $50 million over five years. Grantees exemplify what the trust calls “everyday democracy” as they bring people together to address fundamental concerns such as a fading industry, a dilapidated park, or access to quality health care. This is a rare investment by national philanthropy in small groups in rural America. Over the past few decades, major grantmakers have decreased investments in rural areas, largely due to the shift towards metropolitan regions.",

This is part of a plan for a nationwide grid that will start commercial operations by 2032. The energy transition became urgent after Russia's gas supply stopped due to the Ukraine war. Industry leaders such as steelmakers Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) and ArcelorMittal plan to invest billions of euros in decarbonising steel production, betting on hydrogen's availability. The total cost for the hydrogen network, including 9,666 kilometers of pipelines, is estimated at around 19.7 billion euros.",

The regulations aim to make Advanced Water Purification a viable option for communities across the state, not just major cities like Phoenix and Scottsdale, but also smaller rural providers. The state's regulations are stringent but flexible, as they should be to protect public health, but how providers meet them can vary depending on the quality and quantity of wastewater treated. The draft regulations also outline monitoring and response times for contaminants found in the water. However, setting rigid standards on which tech is used and when in the process could require some providers to do more treatment than they need to clean their water to ultra-pure standards at a much higher cost than necessary. This could make it impractical for smaller, rural providers, particularly for communities that rely solely on groundwater.",

Another tip: Use a plastic pie cover to protect your food from splashing. The author also shares tips on how often to change bedsheets, which are usually changed twice a week. Safety deposit boxes are recommended, but there are concerns that many may be too late for many.",

The technology will enable deep and complex offshore wells to be drilled from a light well intervention vessel rather than a more costly semi-sub or drill ship, saving 30% of well construction cost. The new technology includes sophisticated drilling automation and control systems and real-time wireline communications to the surface. GA Drilling’s success is the result of 10+ years of R&D, 25+ registered patents, and support from a full-time team of over 50 engineers.",

The ship was carrying 1.4 million liters (370,000 gallons) of industrial fuel oil when it was lashed by huge waves and took on water. One crewman was killed and 16 others were rescued in a late-night operation by the coast guard. The coast guard is also investigating whether the vessel is leaking oil, which could reach Manila. The sinking follows days of monsoon rains that left at least 22 people dead and displaced over half a million people. The Coast Guard is preparing for a major spill similar to one in February last year off Oriental Mindoro province.",

The largest active blaze in the U.S. was near the Oregon-Idaho border and was 0% contained, and had burned nearly 400 square miles. Oregon has 31 large active fires that have burned 791,653 acres (320,371 hectares). The largest fire in California is the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara, the largest in Arizona, followed by the Romero Fire west of Dudleyville. In Canada, there are about 430 active wildfires in British Columbia and 177 in neighboring Alberta. Unhealthy air pollution from wildfires has led to air quality alerts and advisories in regions of the western U., including Oregon, Nevada, Southeast, Central Oregon, Southern Idaho, and the Utah and Arizona Strip.",

The earnings press release, including GAAP reconciliation tables and a recording of this call, is available on Republic's website at republicservices.com. During the second quarter, Republic Services achieved a 9% revenue growth, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBTDA margin by 110 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, and produced an adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.

The RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance, and expects to drive $20 million of annual cost savings once fully implemented. The firm's new fleet and equipment management system, MPower, was introduced to pilot locations earlier this month and is expected to increase maintenance, technician productivity, and enhance warranty recovery.",

The council, which spent two days clearing the rubbish, has caused local anger and anger. Councillor Rob Waltham, Leader of North Lincolnshire Council, expressed his anger over the incident, stating that the council is doing everything possible to catch these individuals in the act and enforce the maximum penalty of £1000. The previous clean up saw eight tonnes of 'bulky items' including 60 mattresses, 25 sofas and 40 items of white goods removed, nine tonnes of smaller items, 12 tonnes of general waste, and five tonnes of swept up rubbish such as litter and glass.",

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government plans to establish Great British Energy, a publicly owned body called GB Energy, to spearhead funding in domestic renewable energy projects. The public financing of the body will be funded through windfall taxes levied on oil and gas companies. The government has allocated £8.3 billion ($10 billion) of public funds over the next five years to meet Britain's climate change targets and reduce reliance on foreign imports. GB Energy will also partner with the monarchy's land and property holdings company, the Crown Estate, which owns vast swathes of Britain's seabed. The Crown Estate estimates that its partnership will lease enough offshore land to produce up to 30 gigawatts of new energy, enough to power almost 20 million homes by 2030.",

If successful, this could be a significant breakthrough in the renewable energy sector. However, there are concerns that this new form of generating energy may not work, if at all. Here are three reasons why this investment could succeed, including an increase in demand for renewable energy. The second reason could be due to tax incentives, which can increase the return on investment for green energy projects. The third reason for this investment is that it could disrupt the future of the energy sector due to fluctuating market conditions.",

      "summary": "The author suggests that as humans respond to climate-caused human migration in different ways, historically, we tend to act differently to this phenomenon, including walls, castles, and pueblos, which are resource-intensive defensive measures that can be breached, bridged, and bypassed. These include hard borders, like the Great Wall of China, castles with moats, and walls that look impressive but don't accomplish much and keep societies from using their resources in positive ways. Historically, these include taking in the newcomers into the dominant culture, adopting their foods and music, and providing homes and jobs, forming a new, different whole. However, walls come up when a population has to migrate in a short period of time, leading to cultural breakdown. So far, this has led to increased border militarization and war, racism and demonization of the other, with sanctuary and aid groups underresourced and communities taking in families and individuals. Individuals need to push their communities towards this approach.",

The maximum carbon budget for Paris 2024 has been set at 1.58 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2 eq). This is an ambitious target for Olympic organisers, especially considering the Tokyo 2020 Games generated almost 2 Mt CO2. The exact carbon footprint of Paris 2024 will be known after the games, but it is estimated to be 1.6 MtCO2 eq for 13 to 16 million visitors, or around 100 to 125 kg CO2 emissions per person. De Bortol urges measures to limit global warming and comply with the Paris Agreement.",

The nature recovery strategy does not include an outright ban on glyphosates, but an amendment was passed to reduce use of the controversial weed killer. The Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT) has praised the declaration as a \"bold commitment to action\", highlighting that one in 40 species previously recorded in Dorset are no longer present, and nearly 20 species of bee are nearly extinct.",

The announcement was made at a factory in Cheshire by Starmer at a time when he confirmed that GB Energy will ensure hefty prices drop by 2030. The company, backed by £8.3bn in government funding, will partner with the Crown Estate to develop offshore wind farms, which estimates they will deliver up to 30 gigawatts of wind power enough to supply nearly 20 million homes by 2030, and will help develop these projects before passing them to private companies while maintaining a stake in them. Sir Keid also stated that it will take time for hard-up households to see the benefits of GB Energy but ministers are working towards a fall in power prices by the end of the current parliament.",

      "summary": "The historic Seine, a water that has been contaminated for over 100 years, has been banned for swimming by Paris officials for more than a century. Olympic organizers have invested $1.5 billion into building a large tank under the Seine to hold stormwater during heavy rains and storms, and then the clean water is returned into the Seining. However, testing revealed unsafe levels of bacteria, particularly E. coli and enterococcus, which are responsible for gastrointestinal illnesses, including diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vomiting and nausea. The ultimate decision on whether to hold the marathon swimming and swimming portion of the triathlon in the river will be made by the respective sports’ governing bodies, depending on data gathered by Paris official. If the river continues to have fluctuating levels of pollutants, there are health risks athletes might face if officials decide the river is safe to swim in during the scheduled event.",

Despite being praised for its ambitious pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, South Africa's climate action is seen as being too slow.

However, the country has been increasing coal burners to address power shortages and has backtracked on pledges to shut down eight coal-fired power stations.",

The report, commissioned by the president's office but independent, stated that a six-fold increase in the pace of renewables buildout is needed. It also highlighted a discrepancy between public support and policy commitments, despite pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement a comprehensive plan. While donors are providing $12 billion to fund South Africa's energy transition, the country has been increasing coal production to address power shortages. Last year, officials backtracked on pledges to shut down eight coal-fired power stations and admitted they will not meet their 2030 targets.",

Isle Royale staff have implemented deterrent measures like hazing wolves near campground and putting electric fencing around garbage dumpster areas.",

The company invested over $2 billion in the first half of the year, on track for a full year investment of over $4 billion. This investment is aimed at improving its electric and natural gas infrastructure and generating cleaner energy for communities it serves. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $296 million or $1.43 per diluted share, compared to 2023's $206 million. Other notable achievements included the creation of the Trenton Channel Energy Center, which will store 880 megawatt hours of electricity enough to power nearly 40,000 homes. DTE also helped make the 2024 NFL Draft a carbon-neutral success, partnering with the NFL and Visit Detroit to create a more sustainable environment for visitors.",

The algae, which thrive in damp wood, can lead to wood decay, surface discoloration, and slippery surfaces posing safety hazards. The experts suggest that removing algae from sheds, fences, and garden furniture is essential for prolonging the lifespan of these structures. They suggest using a homemade remedy that involves mixing one part white vinegar with two parts water to create an anti-algae solution for your fence. However, if this fails to work, use a pressure washer. The team also recommends using store-bought wood preservative. Regular maintenance can prevent algae growth and keep garden structures looking good year-round.",

Additionally, the Company increased its liquidity position and capital levels during the quarter, with a pro-forma liquidity of nearly $40 billion resulting in over 300% coverage on our uninsured deposits.",

The fires, believed to be caused by heat waves, have closed about 110 miles of the trail in California and have led to a significant disruption to the 2,650-mile hiking route. The Pacific Crest Association manages thru hiker permits for the trail and has seen increased concern for hikers due to climate-fueled mega-fires that have scorched millions of acres of forest and burned across the Sierra crest. Local volunteers have been assisting hikers near the fire zone, transporting them 100 miles north to a trail junction at Seiad Valley.",

      "summary": "The summer heatwave in Las Vegas, known as the hottest on record, has pushed the desert metropolis to a dangerous level of heat. This summer saw a record seven days at 115F or higher and a record high of 120F. The city experienced a new record high in July, with temperatures reaching 120F in the month leading up to the all-time high of 115F. Meanwhile, Clark county, where Las Vegas is located, is bursting at the seams, with nearly 2 million people having moved to the area in the last 50 years and nearly a million more expected by 2060. The county has supported a federal bill that would open up 25,000 acres of the surrounding desert for housing and commercial development, and plans for a new airport in 2037. The record heat has been particularly impactful for the homeless, with over 5,000 people in the county estimated to be experiencing homelessness. Some residents have sought refuge in underground tunnels during the summer, risking the waters that surge through them during summer monsoons due to exposure to the heat.",

      "summary": "The summer heatwave in Las Vegas, known as the hottest on record, has pushed the desert metropolis to a dangerous level of heat. This summer saw a record seven days at 115F or higher and a record high of 120F. The city experienced a new record high in July, with temperatures reaching 120F in the month leading up to the all-time high of 115F. Meanwhile, Clark county, where Las Vegas is located, is bursting at the seams, with nearly 2 million people having moved to the area in the last 50 years and nearly a million more expected by 2060. The county has supported a federal bill that would open up 25,000 acres of the surrounding desert for housing and commercial development, and plans for a new airport in 2037. The record heat has been particularly impactful for the homeless, with over 5,000 people in the county estimated to be experiencing homelessness. Some residents have sought refuge in underground tunnels during the summer, risking the waters that surge through them during summer monsoons due to exposure to the heat.",

The company outperformed customer vehicle production volumes by 9%. Net income attributable to Visteon was $71 million or $2.54 per diluted share. Net sales were primarily due to strong performance of digital cockpit and electrification products, partially offset by lower customer production and lower customer recoveries due to improved semiconductor supply. Viston's Adjusted EBITDA was a record $136 million in the second quarter, an increase of $46 million compared to the prior year. The company won $3.1 billion in new business in the first half, including nearly $1.8 billion of display wins across 17 different OEMs. The full-year 2024 guidance is now in the range of $385-$3.95 billion, adjusted EBITMA, and adjusted free cash flow is also anticipated.",

Despite logistical challenges, Arch managed to move significant volume of canking coal and successfully repurchased 94,367 shares and declared a $0.25 per share fixed dividend.",

The move is part of a wider effort to reduce UK's reliance on energy imported from other countries by generating more of its own electricity. However, Mr Miliband admitted that it would take time for GB Energy to start generating returns within the lifetime of this Parliament. The government has set aside £8.3bn to invest in new wind farms and solar projects, which must be built before GB Energy can generate a return.",

The quarter also included a severe heatwave that boosted the country's base power demand by 10%. Adani's energy sales increased by 22% year-on-year to 7,356 million units in the quarter, largely attributed to solar energy.

      "summary": "A Philippine oil tanker, Terra Nova, sank in Manila Bay early Thursday amid fears of a major oil spill. The Coast Guard rescued 16 of the 17 crew members in a nighttime operation. The tanker was carrying approximately 1.4 million liters (370,000 gallons) of industrial fuel oil in watertight tanks when it encountered treacherous conditions. The crew's attempts to return to port were unsuccessful, leading to the vessel's sinking. An aerial survey identified a 2.3 mile-long oil slick near the site of the sinking, but initial reports suggest this could be from the tanker's engine fuel rather than the larger cargo. The search for the missing crew member is ongoing and the Coast Guard vessel BRP Melchora Aquino is currently in the area. There are concerns about potential environmental disaster if the oil leaks into Manila Bay, which could severely impact Manila's shorelines.",

      "summary": "Most mining companies aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or later, in line with the Paris Agreement. Many have interim targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by between 30 and 50% by 2030. These targets are often based on the potential to transition from fossil-fuel-generated power to renewable energy. Harmonic Gold is aiming for a 63% decline in emissions by 2036, largely due to a move to renewables from coal-fired grid power in South Africa. A survey by GlobalData found that on-site renewable power is seen as the most viable option for minimising mine site emissions through to the end of the decade. Companies are adopting renewable diesel and biofuels as a “transition pathway” to achieve interim emissions targets, alongside other benefits. BHP has partnered with BP to trial the use of a blended HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) diesel at its Yandi iron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.",

The United States has not signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which created the authority. However, California and several other states have established their own bans and restrictions on seabed mining. California Assemblywoman Luz Rivas (D-North Hollywood), author of a 2022 law banning the practice in state waters, has called on President Biden to place a moratorium on such activity. Mining companies argue that the metals they plan to harvest, such as cobalt and nickel, will help grow the green economy and spare land habitats from disruption. Critics argue that deep sea extraction causes less environmental disruption than mining on land.",

The controversial project crosses two provinces, crosses a national park in the Rocky Mountains, dips underneath bodies of water and passes through dozens of First Nations communities before terminating at a sprawling oil storage facility on the Pacific coast. Despite promises of strong climate action and billions in fossil fuel investments, critics argue that the government has provided massive government subsidies to the oil industry at a time when the planet needs to move away from fossil fuels. The project was initially proposed by Texas company Kinder Morgan in 2012 to triple the existing capacity of a pipeline it bought in 2005. However, delays, cost overruns and inflation have pushed the project far above initial estimates. The cost is now expected to exceed C$25bn.",

The EU’s Copernication Climate Change service reports that the average global temperatures hit 17.16 degrees Celsius, breaking a record set by Sunday. The climate change service suggests that we are not ready for the heat and that we may not be ready for it.",

The company reported a 0.3% increase in revenue to $495.6 million, largely due to acquisitions and a focus on margin over market share. Despite a slowdown in economic growth and the emergence of competitive markets, Mullen Group's CEO, Murray K. Mullen, stated that acquisitions were the only way to grow in the market. He also highlighted the strength of the company's balance sheet, bolstered with the closing of approximately $400.0 million of new debt and the addition of new bank credit facilities. Operating income before depreciation and amortization of $85.7 million was up 2.8 percent from the prior year on $4.7m of incremental OIBDA from acquisitions and improved results in the LTL and S&I segments.",

The company's operating margins in the R&B segment increased 360 basis points from the previous year to 21.9%, primarily due to operating leverage from operating leverage in CRB.

      "summary": "Conservative groups have developed a plan for American agriculture under Project 2025, which includes steep increases in logging, work requirements for food aid, fewer school meals for children, and the elimination of farm subsidies. The proposal is a long shot even if Republicans take control of the government. It would face a confrontation with urban Democrats and a polarized Congress, as well as some of the most powerful players in the Republican coalition. A spokesperson for House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) dismissed the Project 2025 vision as an \"obscure think tank paper\" that didn't represent the chair, committee, or any of our future plans. The agriculture section of Project 2025 also proposes moving SNAP from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Health and Human Services and ending government subsidies for crop insurance.",

Net sales were $10.9 billion, down 4% compared to the year-ago period, and volume increased 1% year-over-year, largely due to gains in the U.S. & Canada. However, local price decreased 4%, with gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India (EMEAI), leading to local price increases of 4% year over the previous year. Operating EBIT1 was $819 million, down $66 million year over year, primarily driven by lower integrated margins and higher planned maintenance activity, which were offset by improved equity earnings. The company returned $691 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $491 million in dividends and $200 million in share repurchases. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment net sales in the same period were $5.5 billion, a 7% decrease from the previous period, driven by gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Packaging.",

The Company reported operating income of $4.5 million compared to $6.3 million in 2023, and net income was $2.8 million or $0.20 earnings per diluted share, compared to the second quarter 2023. Total net sales declined 7.7% on a year-over-year basis due to softening consumer demand and channel inventory destocking. Escalade reported a second quarter gross margin of 24.2%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior-year quarter due to lower fixed cost absorption, increased customer program spending, and severance related expenses associated with the Company's ongoing asset optimization initiative. As of June 30, 2024, the company had total cash and equivalents, and availability on its senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2027 of $71.4 million.",
