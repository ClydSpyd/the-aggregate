The child was found dead in May at 50 pounds and with bruises and deformities to her arms and legs. The new charges also include second and third-degree murders. Malinda was removed from the Coatesville Area School District in January and placed in a cyber school. Police allege that Malinda, who weighed 50 pounds, was starved for months and forced to perform strenuous exercises while chained to furniture, which were allegedly undetected. Prosecutors are set to hold a news conference at a 1 p.m. news conference discussing the new charges.",

Barkley had no idea his conversation with Giants management was recorded and aired on the documentary television series. He insists he was portrayed fairly, despite the recorded call being offside. Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles for $26 million guaranteed and $37.75 million overall, making him the highest-paid running back in franchise history. The show's coverage of Barkley's departure was part of a series detailing his departure from the Giants after six seasons. Since 2001, the show has been a staple of the NFL fans' view of the show, focusing on specific teams during summer training camps and the regular season.",

The cashless, free-flowing mode of collecting tolls eliminates the need for separate toll lanes and booths. Tolls will still be collected, sent to you in mail or deducted from your EZ Pass account. The move to open road tollings will take effect on Jan. 5, 2025 on all parts of the Turnpix east of Reading and on the Northeast Extension. Toll booths for the remainder of the PA Turnpikes, from Reading and westward, will be eliminated in 2027.",

He was charged with five crimes, including taking the officer’s gun, fleeing a police officer, and assault with intent to rob, but these charges were dropped after he pleaded guilty to carjacker and a count of assaulting, resisting and obstructing causing injury of a cop.

He was previously accused of taking his gun after a carjacking in Detroit more than a decade ago. Lopez was released from prison last month after serving about 12 years in that incident. In the 2011 carjacker case, a Detroit Police officer was treated at a hospital and had to have a cast put on his right hand after Lopez admitted to the incident. Lopez admitted stealing a 1997 Dodge Dakota from a man in Detroit and later assaulting the truck owner, permanently injuring the victim's eye. He served 18 years in prison for the two felonies, 18 years shy of the maximum 30-year sentence.",

He was pulled from the cockpit five minutes after the plane went down near Kathmandu airport. The Saurya Airlines plane crashed shortly after takeoff when it turned right and collided with a storage container. The collision tore the cockpit off and sent the rest of the aircraft careening into a valley where it was torn to pieces. Shakya survived the crash but was rescued within five minutes of the crash and rushed to hospital with injuries including broken bones in his back and head and facial injuries. The plane's co-pilot, Sasant Katuwal, had only been flying for three years. An initial assessment suggests that the plane took a wrong turn due to the wrong turn.",

The case, known as the \"Black Swan Murder Trial,\" is being referred to as the case being dubbed \"the Black Swan Murder\" by prosecutors. Prosecutors claim that Ashley wanted to get her husband out of her and her daughter's lives and would \"stop at nothing\" to achieve this goal. The defense claims that Doug Benefield was abusive and intimidating and had previously thrown a loaded gun at Ashley and punched their dog in the face so hard that he knocked the dog unconscious. The state argues that Ashley Benefedged was not injured and that she was armed with a gun she had previously bought while her husband was unarmed.",

The Argentina delegation has filed a police complaint in Lyon and the prosecutor's office of Saint-Etienne has confirmed that the stolen items include midfielder Thiago Almada's watch. This comes amid a troubled start to the Olympics for Argentina, which was awarded gold in 2004 and 2008. The game was suspended for nearly two hours after Morocco fans threw bottles to protest a goal that appeared to be an equalizing goal in the 16th minute of added time. The goal was overturned after being reviewed by the video assistant referee (VAR).",

A Dallas County jury awarded his family $3.6 million in June, largely due to the negligence of a North Texas trucking company and a truck driver. The lawsuit alleges that the truck stopped due to a mechanical issue and the driver did not deploy flares or triangles to warn oncoming drivers. Despite the trial and jury verdict, a final judgment has not yet been entered. A final hearing is scheduled for August 16. The wrongful death lawsuit was first filed in December 2021 by the family and asked for damages no less than $1 million.",

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has informed his French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné, of an alleged Iranian-backed plot to attack the Israeli delegation of athletes. Despite acknowledging the \"unprecedented security measures\" in place by French security forces to protect Israelis attending the games, Katz also noted that French authorities have rejected calls from the Left to ban all Israeli participants from the Olympics. There are currently 88 Israeli athletes at the games and they have been given unprecedented protection from both French and Israeli security services. However, there is no evidence linking the alleged attack to the Paris Olympics yet.",

The center, which includes five miles of hiking trails and a canoe trip, hosts students from both southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island for a coastal field study that includes four unique stations about the environment. Up to 15,000 students visit the center each year. Executive director Rachel Stronach also plans to open a new welcome center later this summer that will meet strict environmental building standards and generate more energy than it uses. The Lloyd Center's mission is to have a positive impact on the students who visit and educate them about coastal and watershed issues.",

The three-count indictment alleges that Matar was motivated by Hezbollah leader's endorsement of a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death. Matar is accused of attempting to carry out the fatwa, which was first issued in 1989 and endorsed by the group's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah. The prosecutor stated that he believed the call was backed by Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the leader. Both state and federal charges will proceed to trial separately.",

He was convicted of one charge of rape and two of sexual assault, and was also found guilty of voyeurism against a fourth woman. The 36-year-old was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing next month. The court heard that Davidson, who used the stage name Wild, revelled in his role as a sex symbol and expected sex on demand, but hid a'sinister side' that included role-playing rape and secretly filming assaults. He confessed to a fetish to wanting sex with a woman while she was asleep and filmed himself groping her breasts.",

White was driving eastbound on St. Clair Avenue above the 35 mph and ran the red light, according to police. The Ford Fusion collided with a Ford Explorer, causing it to roll over and throw the driver from the vehicle. White allegedly told responding police officers he was in the passenger seat during the accident and didn't know who was driving. His arraignment is set for Saturday.",

His arrest was made after he was tipped off by a crypto-currency company that he had purchased child porn photos off the dark web. A forensic search through his phone also revealed a private photo vault app hiding at least 14 pictures of him sexually abusing the girl. Elwing now faces up to 25 charges related to child pornography, including two capital felony raps for sexual battery of a minor. He is currently being held without bond at Manatee County Jail in Palmetto. If convicted, he could face a minimum sentence of life without parole.",

However, Torba stated that while the majority of posts were in support of President Biden, they were critical of his policies, including those of the COVID lockdowns, border policies and executive orders.

Paris had claimed that the officers were unable to locate Thomas Matthew Crooks, who opened fire from a nearby building rooftop and fatally shot three spectators before being shot by a Secret Service agent at the scene.

He also endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and outlined his goals for the rest of his term, including combating gun violence, ending the war in Gaza, and calling for Supreme Court reform. The Durkee Fire has been declared a major infraction in the U.S. after burning nearly 270,000 acres near the Oregon-Idaho border. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Congress to end the Gaza war and prevent a broader war in the Middle East. The first book in Cher's memoir, The Decameron, premiered overnight on Netflix. The latest Marvel movie, Deadpool & Wolverine, is set to be released tomorrow.",

The thief spent 40 minutes entering the salon and stole items such as hairdressing equipment and sentimental items. The damage to the building was more than the value of the items taken. Last month, Ellie was body-shamed for sharing a bikini snap and responded by posting a picture of herself enjoying a chippy tea.",

He said he led a prayer meeting an hour before the incident and had tried to help him for years. The pastor said he then wrestled his grandson to the ground and praised the prayers held an hour earlier. Kendrick's grandson was arrested and charged with capital murder with five counts of capital murder.

The incident occurred at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where one attendee was killed and another two others critically wounded. Social media users shared photos of Trump playing golf with an intact ear with captions claiming it was taken after the shooting. However, these pictures pre-date the assassination attempt. The second photograph, taken in 2022, shows a visibly uninjured Trump wearing a red cap with \"45\" printed on the side.",

The judge will decide if Gonzalez, who was convicted in juvenile court, could be eligible for release on parole when he turns 25 in October. He lured the girl, Madyson \"Maddy\" Middleton, into his parent's apartment and then murdered her before tossing her body into a trash container. Initially charged as an adult with murder, his case was halted in 2019 due to a law that bars 14 and 15 year-olds from being charged as adults.",

Gonzalez was 15 when he lured the girl, Madyson \"Maddy\" Middleton, into his parent's apartment and then murdered her in 2015. He was convicted in juvenile court and could be eligible for parole when he turns 25 in October. Maddy's body was found in a trash container two days later. Initially charged as an adult with murder with the special circumstance that he kidnapped and sexually assaulted Maddy, and other related criminal offenses. However, his case was halted in 2019 due to a law barring 14 and 15-year olds from being charged as adults.",

The case was reopened in June 2024 after the Riverside Police Department's Homicide Cold Case Unit reopened the case. The suspect, who was 32 at the time, allegedly fled to Mexico after being identified as a suspect in the murder. The fatal shooting occurred inside a residence in the 4700 block of Doane Avenue, where 38-year-old Alfonso Vera was found with multiple gunshot wounds. Of the three suspects involved in the shooting, two were arrested but no charges were filed due to a lack of evidence. Contreas was apprehended by civil police in Mexicali and transferred to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Cois M. Byrd Detention Center.",

The vehicle, which was used for activities such as Duke of Edinburgh Award walks and activities, was intended to be used over the summer holidays for activities. The cadets, aged 13-19, had raised funds to buy the vehicle and cover its tax and insurance each year. The theft has been reported to police and Staffordshire Police has been contacted for comment. The bus was insured, but the loss of it is described as a significant loss as it provides a mobile base for the group and transport for their activities.",

The British-American brothers, who were indicted last year by Romanian officials, claim the woman falsely accused them of human trafficking and rape, costing them freedom and millions in income from their social media, podcasting and business ventures.
