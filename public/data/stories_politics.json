The state will provide funding to districts that use a course code that has been in the catalog of state-funded courses since 2020. This follows complaints that the state's refusal to fund an AP course would suppress teaching about Black history. The State Board of Education, appointed by the governor, must approve a class before it can receive state funding. Critics, including state Rep. Jasmine Clark, argued that allowing districts to use an already-existing course code was a \"workaround solution\".",

Many viewers commented on the appearance of a large, dark patch of skin on Biden's left side of his jaw, which was not easily concealed by the skin bronzer covering Biden's face. The bruise also appeared in a photo taken by New York Times photographer Doug Mills of President Trump watching Biden's speech on Trump Force One following a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. The White House is scheduled to hold a briefing on the issue at 1:30 p.m. EDT Thursday.",

The amendment would prohibit Smith from using over $11 million a year allocated to the FBI and US Marshals Service for \"real law enforcement\" during his investigations. This comes as Republicans are looking at ways to defund multiple politicized prosecutions against Trump, including by Smith, Atlanta District Attorney Fani Willis, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. While House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated he would not seek to eliminate Smith's position, he has called for accountability.",

The announcement comes amid ongoing drone and missile attacks by Russia. Spain has pledged €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in support for Ukraine this year and €5 billion by 2027. The country also plans to train 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers. As Ukraine awaits the full delivery of Western-supplied weapons, the Dutch Defense Ministry announced that 14 Leopard 2A4 tanks that had been pledged by the Netherlands and Denmark will be delivered by the end of summer.",

      "summary": "Kamala Harris, former California attorney general, has been known for supporting affordable housing and has proposed similar policies as a potential presidential candidate. Her proposed Rent Relief Act would offer tax credits to renters who earn below $100,000 and spend over 30% of their income on rent and utilities. This version includes a mechanism from the Treasury to pay the tax credit monthly to eligible households. The second version caps the credit at 100% of small area fair market rents instead of 150% of FMR. This comes as Harris announced the recipients of an $85 million grant under the Pathways to Removing Obstacles for Housing, or PRO Housing, aimed to increase building activity and lower housing and rental costs for families in the U.S. The LIFT the Middle Class Act would provide a refundable tax credit of up to $3,000 per person or $6,000 for married couples who file joint tax returns. Some experts suggest that the LIFT Act might be better for renters than the proposed 5% rent cap increase, which could lead to landlords losing access to tax breaks.",

National police have arrived in the region to assist in the investigation, which took place over a week after the violence took place. The bodies of the victims were found floating in the surrounding bush and many were taken by crocodiles. The violence is part of a trend of violence towards land and wealth, following a similar attack in February in the Highlands.",

This comes in response to criticism of the Logan Act, which he has been accused of violating. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delivered an address to Congress and is also meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Israeli leader's visit comes more than nine months into Israel's conflict against Hamas, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking approximately 250 people hostage. Israel has launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza, killing over 39,000 Palestinians.",

      "summary": "The UK's first prime minister, Keir Starmer, has been criticised for his lack of enthusiasm for the weekly PMQs, which he argues is boring and dull. The Telegraph and Independent newspapers criticised the new format of PMQAs as a \"love-in\", while The Times's sketch writer suggested that the new horses needed time to learn to bray. The session, which is now being broadcast globally by the BBC and is a favourite on America's C-Span network, is also a favourite with US's President George HW Bush. The House of Commons is notoriously resistant to reform, with MPs appearing in the show as a Greek chorus but constituents see what they are up to all day. The debate, which focuses on issues of the day, should be more frequent than a regular press conference. The current format of the PMQS is seen as an attempt to make it more engaging and engaging in a more engaging form of debate.",

Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.) has introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision that former presidents enjoy a presumption of criminal immunity for official acts. The proposed amendment would make clear that no official could invoke immunity for criminal actions solely based on their duties. This decision was largely condemned by Democrats who argue that under the Constitution, no one, not even the president, is above the law. Critics argue that the court's decision undermines the founding intentions of the nation's founders.",

      "summary": "The media has been praised for their reporting on President Biden's health, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the 2024 race. Some media figures claimed this disproves conservatives' claim that the media has supported Biden. However, critics argue that this is an attempt to delegatatize Biden's position as a political figure. The media responded by using the term \"cheap fakes\" and smearing people who witnessed the truth as liars. They are now largely back to assisting their Democratic allies ahead of the election. Meanwhile, critics question whether Kamala Harris, who was tapped as Biden's Border Czar, should be allowed to face scrutiny due to her past administration failures and radical policy stances.",

      "summary": "An 83(b) election, a powerful tax planning tool for founders, employees, and executives with stock-based compensation, can accelerate the taxation of unvested company stock. The election, which minimizes taxable income and controls the timing of it, allows individuals to pay tax on these shares now, instead of when they vest. This includes paying tax on the taxable spread at grant, rather than when the stock vesting requirements. The difference between the exercise (or purchase) price and the current fair market value of the stock is taxable, either as ordinary income (for restricted stock and non-qualified stock options) or for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) calculation (for incentive stock options). The election can be made in conjunction with an early exercise of stock options or profits interests in an LLC or partnership. Startup founders, early employees, executives, and other service providers can also make an 83B election. The key benefit of this election is having more control over your tax situation and equity. An 83B) election can also be made to shift taxable income entirely to more favorable long-term rates. The eligibility period for this election includes qualifying small business stock (Section 1202) and qualifying for tax-free stock sales.",

The committee's leader, Virginia Foxx, has criticized the Education Department for not fully cooperating with federal investigations into changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFASA), which led to delays in the application process. The GAO has launched two separate investigations into the issue and confirmed its staff attended a summer conference for financial aid workers. Many congressional Republicans have criticized the administration's FAFSA rollout and support cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from the budget of the office that oversees the form. The move comes as Congress considers a bill to require the Education Dept. to release the next version of the FAFAS for financial assistance by Oct. 1, which was delayed until after Christmas.",

However, critics argue that this is not true, as people like laughter. In Trump's vision of American carnage, only acceptable laughter comes from cruelty. Harris' laughter signals good humor, high spirits, and a zest for life. However this has not been widely received by the MAGA faithful. The right to laugh shouldn't be controversial, but there have been men historically who have hated the sound of a woman laughing.",

The former president has been in regular contact with Harris and plans to endorse her soon, with discussions reportedly ongoing about appearing together on the campaign trail. This endorsement could further boost the Harris campaign, as Vice President Joe Biden is set to give the keynote speech at the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) national convention. Delegates for the AFT voted to endorse Harris’s bid to become the first woman and second African American to serve as president of the United States. Other high-profile Democrats have also endorsed Harris, including Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton.",

The grant will be used to expand the program, which has significantly reduced the amount of food waste sent to the landfill. The program, launched in 2023, has been highly successful and has diverted 33.65 tons of food from the Seneca Meadows Landfill. The cost of disposing of food scraps costs $20 per ton per ton, compared to $115 per ton for disposing solid waste, reduces carbon emissions and reduces waste by fewer truck trips to the Senec landfill. With the grant, Kingston will implement a five-pronged organics diversion program.",

The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Russian appeals to be reinstated as the team event gold medalist, following the loss of star skater Kamila Valieva in a doping case. The ruling ensures that the U.S. team will receive their medals at the Paris Summer Games. Special medal ceremonies are planned for the Paris Olympics to honor athletes whose results have been upgraded due to doping cases. The Canadian team is awaiting a verdict in a separate appeal to be upgraded from fourth to third, knocking Russia off the podium.",

The five-bedroom home was searched thoroughly by agents from the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn. The reason for the raid was unclear and Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, have not been accused of any criminal activity. Sun, who has worked in various government roles across New York State, left state service last year following allegations of misconduct that were serious enough to be referred to law enforcement.",

      "summary": "The band's stage persona has changed significantly since their early stage persona in 2004, with their focus on the serious nature of their music. Daniel Kessler, Paul Banks, and AdamJosephByrne, who have been together for 20 years, discuss their appreciation of the connection between their music and their audience. They also share their fondest memories from recording or touring Antics, which had leaked and fans in Spain came up to them talking about it. The band was concerned about losing respect for their song \"Untitled\" in Friends, but avoided certain commercial licences to avoid potentially undermining their legitimacy. They have also shared memories of being stranded on the bus during a tour in 2014, including being stuck outside Buffalo for days.",

The rules committee approved a proposal that delegates from around the country could vote on potential presidential nominees to replace President Joe Biden, who ended his reelection bid. Harris is the only major Democrat to announce publicly that she is seeking the nomination, meaning she will likely be approved in a single round of virtual balloting. The process requires 300 electronic signatures from convention delegates by July 30, not more than 50 of whom can be from the same state. If multiple candidates qualify, it could lead to multiple rounds of voting over several days. Delegates voting \"uncommitted\" or for another candidate who hasn't qualified under the rules, will have their choices converted to \"present.\"",

Despite her connections with tech industry, Harris has also pushed for tech accountability in key areas such as AI safety measures and transparency among top tech firms and the government. She can also claim to some of the pro-tech actions taken by the Biden administration, including the Chips Act, which set aside funding for US-production of critical computing components.",

      "summary": "New Jersey's paid family leave program, which allows people to take time off to care for sick relatives or a new baby while earning 85% of their earnings, excludes over 1.7 million hourly workers due to the law not allowing employers to fire them. To participate in the program, workers must have worked at the same employer for a year and have logged at least 1,000 hours of work. This loophole excludes younger hourly employees, typically women in healthcare, food preparation and education fields. A study by Rutgers University suggests that lawmakers should loosen these requirements so people are not forced to lose a job at their family's greatest time of needs.",

Despite acknowledging the \"unprecedented security measures\" in place by French security forces to protect Israelis attending the games, Katz also noted that French authorities have rejected calls from the Left to ban all Israeli participants from the Olympics. There are currently 88 Israeli athletes at the games and they have been given unprecedented protection from both French and Israeli security services. However, there is no evidence linking the alleged attack to the Paris Olympics yet.",

      "summary": "Christopher Oldstone-Moore, author of Of Beards And Men: The Revealing History of Facial Hair, has noted that politics will determine whether the return of beards is on the rise. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw a significant increase in beards and facial hair in the White House, with nine of the next 11 presidents having either a beard or a mustache. However, this trend ended when William Taft, the 27th president, was replaced by King Camp Gillette's safety razor invention in 1901, which made shaving easier and more accessible. The association of clean-shavenness with regularity, efficiency, cooperation, and reliability was a key masculine value in the 20th Century and present, according to the author. Researchers at Oklahoma State University found that voters perceived those with beards as more masculine and more competent, but they also perceived them as less supportive of feminist issues and less likely to support women's rights.",

Speaking on Fox News' Fox & Friends, Trump called for those who burn or damage the American flag to receive a \"one-year jail sentence.\" This follows recent pro-Palestinian protests in Washington, D.C. ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress. The calls for penalties for such acts violate a past ruling by the Supreme Court in 1989, which stated that a man who burned the flag was using a form of \"symbolic speech\" protected by the First Amendment. In response, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989, but the court ruled it unconstitutional in 1990.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump's obsession with Hannibal Lecter, the late great character from Silence of the Lambs, has led to speculation that he may replace his running mate, JD Vance. During a rally in North Carolina, Trump mentioned Lecter as his next VP. This reference has been made numerous times throughout the campaign, with many believing it is related to the term'mental asylum' and \"asylum seeker\". These theories suggest that Trump may confuse the definition of asylum and mistakenly believe all immigrants seeking asylum are automatically insane. However, it is unclear whether Trump believes Lecter is alive or not. The use of the phrase \"the late, great Hannibal Lecters\" suggests that he might be unable to distinguish fiction from reality.",

His supporters praised him for placing the truth on the most important stage in the world. However, critics accused him of being absurd and cynical. While Netanyahu made no mention of the ceasefire agreement under negotiation, the families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas expressed anger. They accused him deliberately sabotaging their chances of bringing their loved ones home. Hamas suggested that it would have been better to arrest Netanyahu as a war criminal and give him the opportunity to cover up mass ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip.",

      "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress was met with praise and criticism from his supporters and critics. His speech was seen as historic, powerful, and moving, but was criticised as absurd and cynical by some of his critics. While Netanyahu defended Israel's military campaign against Iran, he made no mention of the ceasefire agreement under negotiation and postponed the Israeli delegation to the next round of talks in Qatar. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) also condemned the speech, accusing Israel of starving Gaza and of using it as a cover to “escape punishment\". Hamas responded by accusing Netanyahu of spreading propaganda and giving him an opportunity to cover up mass killings and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.",

The ad, which includes an unnamed Hispanic man translating Eigel's message into Spanish, promises to send illegal immigrants \"back where they came from\" and \"throw them in jail\". However, local leaders have accused the ad of being racist. Eigel responded by saying he was just promising to carry out the law and not racist. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that there are around 50,000 unauthorized immigrants living in Missouri, with at least 63% of those eligible to work.",

The NYPD confirmed that the bomb was operable and could have killed or maimed people if it detonated. Wrenwick was taken into custody and the street was cordoned off as a bomb disposal device was brought to a disposal truck.",

Whitmer urged Harris to make a seat at the table for people who have traditionally not traditionally sat at this table. This is particularly crucial as reproductive rights are at risk and one third of women live in a state where they lack the ability to make their own decisions about their own body and healthcare. Political scientist Erik C. Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communication at Northwestern University, also advised Democrats to mobilize different constituencies around different issues, such as abortion. While Donald Trump narrowly won the state in 2016, President Joe Biden won in 2020 by 154,000 votes.",

      "summary": "The history of vice presidential picks has been examined since 1945 to determine whether a senator, governor, or a non-elected U.S. House representative will be chosen as a running mate for the upcoming Vice President election. Since 1945, presidential candidates have made 31 vice presidential choices, with 19 most recently served in elected office as U.K. senators, four governors, and seven who had prior electoral experience only from the House of Representatives. Democrats have chosen a senator in 16 cases since 1945, while Republicans have been more diverse in their selections. The historical record indicates that the prior job of the running mate makes little difference in victory or defeat if it is a senator or governor. However, those without gubernatorial or senatorial experience have fared poorly.",

This comes after a police officer was filmed apparently stamping on a man's head at the airport. After the clip was widely shared online, hundreds of protesters gathered outside a Rochdale police station and chanted \"Allahu Akbar\". Labour MPs have also raised concerns with senior officers in Greater Manchester Police regarding the incident. Burnham stated that he would work with the Independent Office for Police Conduct to ensure a high level of neutrality in its investigation. His comments came as Akhmed Yakoob, a lawyer who ran as an independent at the election on a pro-Gaza ticket, released a video of himself with two men arrested at Manchester Airport.",

Clyburn cited contested Democratic primaries in 1968, 1972 and 1980 as reasons for the party's disarray, citing that the party doesn't \"win when we show ourselves to the American people as being in disarray.\" He urged Democrats to have a lovefest and hold themselves accountable for their ability to get along.",

McRaven was commander of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command between 2008 and 2011, and served as head of the United States Special Ops Command from August 2011 to 2014. He also served as Chancellor of the University of Texas System for over three years.

This comment was particularly notable as a reference to a jury verdict of nearly three dozen felonies. The comments were part of an attempt to counterbalance the criticism of former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race. This comes as part of a broader trend of suggesting that those who stand in his way are ineligible for American ballots should not be able to run. Despite this, Trump has a reputation for being anti-democracy and has previously stated that Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Joe Biden shouldn't have been \"allowed\" to run against him.",

      "summary": "Taylor Swift's political history has raised concerns about whether she will support Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. Some fans believe that she already indicated her support for Harris during an Eras Tour concert in Hamburg, Germany, during which she played a mashup of her songs \"Last Great American Dynasty\" and \"Run\" during the event. While her team did not respond to a request for comment, it is common for Swift to fuse two songs together in a final thought. Jake Deyton, a TikTok influencer, is backing the presumptive Democratic nominee and suggested in a video that Harris should use her marketing skills to help her campaign. However, some Swifties believe that Taylor should empower her fans to vote for whoever aligns with their beliefs, values, opinions and morals.",

      "summary": "The National Gallery in London is set to display John Constable's 1821 painting, ‘The Hay Wain’ as a “contested landscape” in an upcoming exhibition. The painting depicts a rural landscape near Constable’s native Suffolk, but some critics argue it hides a hidden secret. The National Gallery curator, Dr Mary McMahon, stated that the painting was intended to explain the full social context of the painting and will be displayed alongside satirical images from the period. Other controversial exhibitions include a removal of a painting showing Jesus and other biblical figures depicted with Looney Tunes-style faces from a local gallery in Sydney, which was seen as undue censorship. Last year, Tate Britain changed its historical offering with an \"inclusive\" reimagining of its gallery, following a commitment to race equality.",

William McRaven, former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, removing his name from consideration. The New York Times reported that Harris’ shortlist includes Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and other potential candidates. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the campaign has also reached out to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for consideration.",

The case could be decided as early as today in Alaska v. Department of Education, which is being partially blocked by Republican state attorneys general in Alaska, South Carolina and Texas, could also be resolved. The Supreme Court previously struck down a plan by President Joe Biden that would have eliminated $430 billion in student loans for over 40 million borrowers. The Biden administration has also filed two emergency applications with the Supreme Court to narrow a pair of nationwide injunctions that blocked the Education Department's new Title IX rules from going into effect. The court's final ruling on the issue is expected before the end of the 2023-2024 term.",

Cable, who was business secretary for an unusually long period between 2010 and 2015, stated that he never learned who lead campaigner Sir Alan Bates was until before he left office and that he was not informed about the scandal's lead campaigner. He also expressed frustration that he only began to “smell a rat” in March 2015, just before parliament was dissolved. Cable agreed with the description of Post Office management as “thugs” and had a goal of improving the relationship between management and branch owners-operatives during his time in office. He admitted he should have been more thoroughly briefed on the Horizon system at the time.",

The judge stated that the site's assets were 22 times the size of its liabilities and that there is no present financial distress, no looming foreclosure sale, or prospect of a market crash. Filing for bankruptcy stops all civil proceedings against a business and allows it to consolidate litigation in one court.",

      "summary": "The China-Russia axis is expanding into Europe, claiming Belarus and possibly Georgia. This move, along with the recent defense agreement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Russian Federation, is seen as a strengthening of the anti-US, anti-Western axis. This axis includes Iran and is strengthening its ties with Russia’s ally Belarus. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are becoming a tightly-knit bloc that provides diplomatic support for each other and helps each heavily sanctioned member survive. The axis aims to diminish the influence of the United States while constraining the expansion of NATO. Belarus is part of this axis due to its deep political and military integration with Russia.",

The unrest was sparked by protests against a public jobs quota scheme that critics argue gives preference to allies of Hasina's ruling party. Despite the deaths, Hasina condemned protesters for damaging city infrastructure and ordered a curfew to allow free movement between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm. Students Against Discrimination, the group behind the protests, demanded an apology from Hasina for the mass murder of students and demanded the sacking of the home minister and education minister. The government has also been accused of misusing state institutions to maintain its grip on power and stamp out dissent.",

Jean Carroll. In her 21-page ruling, Judge Cecilia Altonaga rejected ABC's multiple claims to protection, including their assertion that they were not liable for defamation under the \"fair reporting privilege.\" The lawsuit is seeking an unspecified amount of money in compensation for damages.",

The signatories, including Sir Lenny Henry, the artist Anish Kapoor, Sophie Okonedo, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, David Harewood and Paterson Joseph, and the writer Kamila Shamsie, argued that the rules were an attack on the democratic rights of people of colour and that they should be abolished. The letter also called for automatic voter registration, where people are automatically added to the electoral roll by reference other databases rather than having to actively register. It criticises the Conservative government for introducing the law to further their own political interests, which the Conservatives reject.",

He said he wants Harris to focus on the plight of the American working class if she wins. Sanders' support depends on how much Harris chooses to embrace policies impacting working-class voters. Other progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, have already endorsed Harris.",

She believes that individual sporting bodies should be able to decide whether to allow biological males to compete against women in their fields. She also stated that biology matters in sport and that it is impossible to ensure fairness without taking biology into account. The Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board are among those allowing transgender athletes to compete in female-only events if they meet certain criteria, such as low testosterone levels. The previous Tory government called for a total ban on trans people participating in elite-level women’s events. Nandy supports the trans community, stating that they are the most marginalised group of people in the country.",

      "summary": "The author argues that while women in the United States of America have less money than men, they also have less net assets at the end of their careers. This is due to the higher education and higher-paying roles in finance and law that pay well. However, this gap has narrowed significantly as more women have higher education, work in finance, which pays well. The author suggests that men invest better in their money, reinvesting in the same types of instruments as women, and that their investments improve returns.
