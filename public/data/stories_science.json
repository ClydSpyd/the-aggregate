The study author, Diego Diel, did not identify any core mutations in the genome sequence of the disease, suggesting it may be adapting to different mammal hosts.

The planet, roughly the same diameter as Jupiter, has six times the mass and its atmosphere is rich in hydrogen like Jupiter’s. It takes up to 250 years to complete an orbit around its star and is 15 times farther from its star than Earth is to the sun. The discovery was made by an international team led by Max Planck Institute for Astronomy's Elisabeth Matthews in Germany. The Webb telescope, set to be launched in 2021, is the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever placed in space.",

The number of Chinese scientists choosing to relocate to mainland China and Hong Kong has also increased from 48% in 2010 to 67% in 2021. While most China-born, US-based scientists intend to stay in the US, departures have grown steadily, from 900 to 2,621 in 2021, according to the study. The study used the database Microsoft Academic Graph to identify 19,955 scientists of Chinese descent who later left for other countries, including China. It also found that 42% were afraid of conducting research in the United States, while 65% worried about collaborations with China.",

      "summary": "A super Jupiter has been spotted around a neighboring star by the NASA's Webb Space Telescope, taking over a century to complete its orbit. The planet is roughly the same diameter as Jupiter, but with six times its mass and its atmosphere is rich in hydrogen like Jupiter's. It takes over 100 years to complete this orbit, and is 15 times the distance from its star than Earth is to the sun. The observations were collected by an international team led by the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy’s Elisabeth Matthews in Germany. The star is so close and bright to our own solar system that it can be seen with the naked eye in the Southern Hemisphere. The discovery could help scientists understand how planets like Jupiter evolve over giga-year timescales.",

The new instrument was provided for Danuri, a South Korean orbiter that arrived at the moon in December. Since 2009, almost all of the moon's surface has been photographed in detail by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, but its camera is not sensitive enough to see anything in these permanently shadowed Craters. While the new instrument takes superlong exposures, increasing sensitivity by a factor of about 200, scientists have found that the shadowed areas are not pitch-black. The images reveal white spots on the surface, but so far no ice has been found.",

The site, which dates back to when Caligulas snubled his people as they pleaded for help from him, was found in a wall of brick and travertine marble, with foundations of a colonnaded portico behind. Daniela Porro, special superintendent of Rome, directed the excavation and confirmed that this was where the fateful meeting occurred. The discovery also includes a large open area thought to be the former Horti of Agrippina, named for Caligur's mother, which was discovered during the excavations. The first antisemitic pogrom during his rule in Alexandria, Egypt, occurred during a time of tension between the city's Jewish and Greek populations due to their monotheistic faith.",

He and a deputy were able to put the bird in the back seat of the patrol vehicle to cool down. The Arizona Raptor Center picked up the bird, which was a young eagle separated from its parents. Officials estimated that the eagle probably wouldn't have survived if not for Sergeant Giralde's actions. The center's recommendations for helping injured birds in Arizona include bringing the animal to Liberty Wildlife at 2600 E. Elwood St. in Phoenix, keeping it in a warm, dark, quiet environment, and not using an eyedropper to give the bird water.",

The world record time for completing the 13.5 inch course is 2 minutes flat, which would take snails more than six days to travel a mile. Snail racing is a form of locomotion that requires 12 times as much energy as running. Nicholas Dickinson, who organizes the race with his fellow snail master Ian Haynes, said the glacial pace of the gastropods is the result of Olympic-level exertion. The winning snail, Jeff, was crowned the new world champion.",

      "summary": "The national museum of Ireland received two 4,000-year-old bronze age axe heads from an anonymous source last month, which were wrapped in foam inside a porridge box. The museum appealed for more information about the find but was unable to confirm its location. Farmer Thomas Dunne, from County Westmeath, identified as the mysterious sender, who made the discovery while using a metal detector on his land. It is illegal in Ireland to search for archaeological objects without permission and could result in up to three months in prison or a fine of up to €63,486. Researchers from the national museum have now visited the site to log it in an effort to find more information on the people who lived there 4,00 years ago.",

The pair had re-introduced 200,000 pollinators to the area without permission and have warned that it would be a 'travesty' for the city and its plants if threats to re-home their beloved bees are carried out. The row started after the retirement of a plot owner who kept bees, prompting the return of bees to the site in April. Despite receiving no complaints, the council has ordered them to remove the hives or face eviction from the site after being spotted during a routine inspection. The council, known for encouraging wildflower areas, has been accused of hypocrisy by the owners who are seeking retrospective permission.",

The failed assault led to the deaths of 40 invaders and injuries of 37 more. Ukraine's paratroopers destroyed six Russian tanks and seven advancing armoured combat vehicles, and the Russian attack group was targeted by anti-tank gunners. The Russian army launched the assault from several directions and involved 57 armoured vehicles, 11 tanks, 12 motorcycles, and 200 assault vehicles. The Ukrainian brigade had spotted the Russian equipment in advance and attacked them through relentless artillery fire. The British Army head General Sir Roly Walker warned that if Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, it will take five years for its forces to achieve a minimum goal of fully capturing just four regions at a loss of up to 1.8 million soldiers.",

The maximum carbon budget for Paris 2024 has been set at 1.58 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2 eq). This is an ambitious target for Olympic organisers, especially considering the Tokyo 2020 Games generated almost 2 Mt CO2. The exact carbon footprint of Paris 2024 will be known after the games, but it is estimated to be 1.6 MtCO2 eq for 13 to 16 million visitors, or around 100 to 125 kg CO2 emissions per person. De Bortol urges measures to limit global warming and comply with the Paris Agreement.",

Despite her older age, Freddy, who is now nursing Jameel, proved remarkably adaptable to her role as a mother. The experience has revealed the adaptability of gorillas and how they function as a family group. The zoo is the first zoo in the world to foster a baby gorilla from the start, with Freddy taking over raising another gorilla, Kayembe, after his birth mother failed to properly care for him following his birth. An analysis of Freddy's milk found it contained proper levels of calories and nutrients.",

Instead, it gave Nepal more time to restore the gardens and temple that are falling into disrepair. UNESCO had recommended placing it on the agency's list of sites in danger due to the deterioration of key features. The move was meant to garner international support for conservation efforts rather than punishment. However, it can lead to the site being dropped from UNESCO's prestigious list of heritage sites. The World Heritage committee noted Nepal's efforts to preserve the site and gave Nepal until 2025 to submit a new report on the state of conservation.",

Patrick Downey, President & CEO of Orezone, expressed excitement over the project's potential transformation and potential life-of-mine growth. The initial 30,00m first pass drill program will consist of 5,000m of drilling centered on the Maga Zone, with drilling progressing towards the southern half of the mining lease. Potential exploration also includes exploration of the P17 Trend, which could potentially sequence higher-grade ounces into the front end of the mine plan and expand gold production.",

This has led to the virus spreading between cows and even jumping to other animals, including cats and a raccoon. So far, 11 human cases have been reported in the U.K., four of which were linked to cattle farms and seven to poultry farms. While whole genome sequencing did not reveal any mutations making bird flu more transmissible to humans, this suggests that the virus may be adapting in mammals. The concern is that potential mutations could lead to human adaptation, spillover into humans, and efficient transmission in humans. The study was funded by the AHDC, the Ohio Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory, the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostics Laboratory and the USDA.",

The World Heritage Committee noted Nepal's ongoing efforts to preserve the site and gave Nepal until 2025 to submit a new report on the state of conservation. The decision was made at its annual meeting, with Lebanon arguing against the extension. UNESCO experts had recommended placing it on the endangered list due to the deterioration of key features.

      "description": "The United Nations' cultural agency decided Thursday against putting the Buddhist pilgrimage destination of Lumbini on its list of heritage sites in danger, instead giving authorities in Nepal more time to help restore the famous gardens and temple that are falling into disrepair.  Lumbini is the birthplace of Buddha according to Buddhist tradition, and was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.  Experts from UNESCO had recommended placing it on the agency's list of sites in danger, saying that the deterioration of key features to the site shows an “alarming state of conservation.”",

The decision was made by the World Heritage Committee, which maintains the UNESCO list and the conservation of the sites, which can lead to a site being dropped from UNESCO's prestigious list of heritage sites. The committee noted Nepal's ongoing efforts to preserve the site and gave the country until 2025 to submit a new report on the state of conservation. L.umbini was made a World Heritage Site in 1997 and regularly attracts over a million visitors a year.",

The researchers compared 107 published studies to their findings, which found that light to moderate drinkers had a 14% lower risk of dying during the study period compared to abstainers. However, higher quality studies that included people relatively young at the start and excluded former and occasional drinkers did not link moderate drinking to a longer life. The study also found that there is no completely ‘safe’ level of drinking and that the previously held position that some level of alcohol was good for the heart has been revised.",

      "summary": "LADY alumni Nicky and Steve Fitzgerald, along with cofounder Steve Mitchell, have created a new safari camp Angama Amboseli, a new contemporary safari lodge in southern Kenya's Amboseled National Park and the 5,700-acre Kimana Sanctuary. The lodge, which opened in 2023, will be sister to the high-end Angama Mara resort in Kenya's Maasai Mara. It is also a hub for wildlife exploration, providing a crucial wildlife corridor and exclusive use of the sanctuary. The partnership with conservation nonprofit Big Life has been instrumental in reducing human-wildlife conflict in the area, with Angama's deal with the Kimana landowners partnership worth $11 million over 25 years (a significant investment currently unmatched by other existing area accommodation). The resort is bringing new attention to the region's star megafauna, as hunting by license is legal in nearby Tanzania and three large-tusked Amboseling-ecosystem elephants were recently trophy-hunted as recently as March.",

The Muir was built in 1872 and carried mainly grain and other cargoes throughout the Great Lakes until it sank in 1893.

      "summary": "A wildlife researchers have successfully relocated a prairie dog colony in Yukon, Oklahoma, where they captured over three-dozen prairie dogs and relocated them to a site in northwestern Oklahoma. The nearly 18-acre plot, which was recently sold for over $2.1 million, was located within Oklahoma City limits and had recently been for sale. The relocation was led by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation and researchers from the University of Louisiana. Kurt Kuklinski, wildlife diversity and research supervisor at the Oklahoma department of Wildlife, said the colony still has far more prairie animals than the 38 captured last week. The current property owner, Nandini LLC, has insisted that non-lethal means should be used to remove the animals. After their capture, samples of blood and tissue were taken for research purposes before being moved to a wildlife management area.",

      "summary": "Researchers from the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University Pakistan have discovered that naturally occurring sugar, 2-deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR), can stimulate hair growth in mice. The sugar was found to be equally effective at restoring hair to the balding rodents as commercially available drug minoxidil, also known as Rogaine. The researchers applied the sugar to the skin in a gel, which increased the growth of blood vessels, but found that the hair grew back much faster in the areas around the wound where the gel was applied. The research suggests that using a naturally occurring deoxy ribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles could provide a safer, naturally occurring alternative to current treatments.",

The study involved using a flint tool to butcher two carrion crows, two collared doves and a wood pigeon, all of which the Neanderthals ate. The methods were selected based on archaeological evidence. The raw birds were butchered raw, then roasted over hot coals until cooked, then butbutred. The researchers found that using the flint flake required “significant precision and effort” and required careful handling to make precise cuts without injuring one’s fingers. The findings could help archaeologists identify visible signs of Neanderthal food preparation in past records. However, further research is required for larger samples and diverse experimental conditions.",

      "summary": "Experts have called for caution following a whale's breach and boat strike off the coast of Rye, New England, off the Gulf of Maine, which was captured on camera by a student student and has been shared globally. The whale landed on the boat's engine and caused the vessel to tip upward and roll over, sending two fishermen into the Atlantic. The quick rescue of the fishermen, Ryland Kenney and Greg Paquette, was performed by brothers Wyatt Yager, 19, and Colin Yager from Eliot, Maine, who took the video of the incident. Experts are urging boaters to be aware of the whale's movements as it feeds in the area. Ashley Stokes, director of Seacoast Science Center Marine Mammal Rescue, noted that menhaden, also known as \"pogies,\" are being found in abundance this summer, a fish sought by fishermen as bait for striped bass and by whales as food. The jury is still out on whether the whale that hit the 23-foot boat is the same behemoth that previously seen in Kittery’s Pepperrell Cove and the Piscataqua River is believed to be the same whale.",

Airlines cancelled over 46,000 flights in a single day, and the New York Film Forum switched to cash payments as its credit card system went down. The incident was blamed on a misconfigured database, which crashed around one million sites and resulted in a significant loss of business and business. This incident has been seen as a warning to never push updates out on a Friday. Other notable internet outages include a near total internet blackout in Bangladesh following a government shutdown following violent clashes between protesters and police. The most recent internet failure was the Y2K Bug, which predicted a global computer failure in 2000.",

The command intercepted two Russian Tu-95 and two Chinese H-6 warplanes operating in the Alaska Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). This was also the first time a Chinese aircraft had flown into the ADIZ, an international airspace that acts as a buffer zone with sovereign territory. US F-16 and F-35 fighter jets and Canadian CF-18s intercepted the Chinese and Russian bombers, which remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace. The incident comes amid increasing military ties between China and Russia, with General Gregory Guillot warning of China's potential to act in the far north.",

The telescope used a coronagraph to capture the faint light from this far-off planet, which is similar to Jupiter but more massive than any other planet previously imaged. The discovery was published in the science journal Nature. The Webb telescope, a collaboration between NASA, the ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency, is designed to peer into the deep cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. It also provides a unique view of ancient objects and planets in our galaxy.",

The average global temperature for Monday was 62.87°F (17.15°C) - 0.1°F hotter than Sunday, which was also the hottest. This makes it likely that three consecutive days of global record breaking heat could occur. The record-breaking temperatures are attributed to unseasonably warm oceans, higher temperatures in Antarctica, the western United States, Canada and eastern Siberia. The European climate service Copernicus (CS3) director, Carlo Buontempo, said these peaks are not isolated and climate is warming due to the increase in greenhouse gases emitted by the fossil fuel industry. He warned that as the climate keeps warming, new records are expected to be broken in the future.",

The species is found down in Mexico, where it is more common, where thousands of Kemp’s ridley sea turtles emerge simultaneously to nest. However, before the 1990s, there were no similar nesting sites in Texas, with 339 confirmed in Texas during the nesting season. The conservationists use “turtle CSI” and genetic testing to identify the maternity of nests. Despite predictions in 2011 that the species would have rebounded by 2024, the species's nesting numbers continue to fluctuate.",

This discovery could have significant implications for tackling climate change. The study compared hundreds of tree stems in forests across the Amazon and Panama, Sweden, and the UK. It found that trees absorb methane from their trunks and branches, providing a long-term store of carbon. This could be used to enhance the removal of methane from the atmosphere, which can occur rapidly if enhanced. The researchers estimate that trees take up between 25 and 50 million tonnes of atmospheric methane each year, most of which is taken up by tropical forests. However, deforestation and reforestation can influence atmospheric methane.",

His severed leg was found washed up on the beach and placed on ice. He was rushed to John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle with severe blood loss and underwent a major operation. Despite this, it is unclear whether his leg has been reattached. An off-duty police officer saved Mr McKenzie's life by using his dog's leash as a makeshift tourniquet to stem the loss of blood. Despite these setbacks, Mr McKenzie faces a long recovery road, including six to eight weeks if the limb is not reattatched and at least one year if surgery is successful.",

The research involved a sugar sugar that naturally occurs in the body and helps form DNA, the 'deoxyribose' part of deoxyribonucleic acid. Researchers applied this sugar to male mice with testosterone-driven hair loss and found that within weeks their fur began growing back faster than in untreated mice. The gel was found to be equally effective with minoxidil, a topical treatment for hair loss, and could potentially be used to treat alopecia or stimulate hair, lash, and eyebrow regrowth following chemotherapy. However, further research is required to confirm the results.",

The tooth was found in sand brought for the Natural History Museum's Lyme Regis Fossil Festival in Dorset. It was identified as belonging to a prototomus, a meat-eating animal similar in size to a weasel or mongoose. The museum's Dr Neil Adams described the find as a \"very nice find\". The find has been donated to the museum and could potentially reveal more about the animal's last days to weeks of its life.",

The reptiles, which first appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago, are estimated to have about 50,000 left in the wild. The zoo's new habitat will house six animals to recreate their natural habitat for the zoo's conservation breeding programme. The animals' third eye, which senses the intensity of sunlight and regulates body temperature, navigation, and hormone regulation, is not used for sight. Conservationists believe their demise was due to introduced species and a changing climate.",

The discovery raises concerns about collision risks faced by endangered marine animals. The female 7m long basking Shark was tagged with a device similar to a FitBit and a connected camera, which was designed to be released from the animal at a predetermined time. However, when the tag was released seven hours after the strike, researchers found that the shark never resumed feeding or other normal behavior. This is the first direct observation of a ship strike on any marine megafauna that scientists are aware of. The findings suggest the risk of vessel strikes on marine animals and the need for measures to combat this threat.",

Leo will reign in spending and may want to end a subscription service that is no longer valuable.

Capricorn will learn from skepticism and skepticism, especially when people try to sway your beliefs.",

The researchers compared 107 published studies, which combined their data to show that light to moderate drinkers had a 14% lower risk of dying during the study period compared to abstainers. However, higher quality studies that included people who were relatively young at the start and excluded former and occasional drinkers did not link moderate drinking to a longer life. The study, published in the Journal Of Studies On Alcohol and Drugs, found that lower quality studies with older people and no distinction between former drinkers and lifelong abstainers were found to be linked to greater longevity. The NHS has revised its position that some level of alcohol was good for the heart, stating that the evidence on the protective effect from moderate drinking is less strong than previously thought.",

The new method involves using a surrogate parent to rear the chicks, rather than raising them by hand. The newborn birds will be considered for release into the wild under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's California Condor Recovery Program. The technique is a modification from a previous method used when more fertilized eggs were available. Despite this success, the species remains at risk from lead poisoning and other toxins.",

The study, published in the journal Environment International, found that shorter-chain PFAS are absorbed more easily through the skin and into the bloodstream compared to longer-chain compounds. This discovery raises additional concerns about routine exposure to PFAS through products that come into contact with the skin.PFAS have been linked to several types of cancer, infertility, high cholesterol, low birthweights, and negative effects on the liver, thyroid, and immune system. Consumer actions can include seeking out PFAS-free personal care and beauty products, supporting policies that restrict PFAS in consumer goods, and advocating for broader action to protect public health and the environment.",

      "summary": "A NASA spacecraft has discovered that Mercury, the solar system's smallest planet, may have a 10-mile thick mantle layer of diamonds beneath its surface. The discovery was made using data from NASA's MESSENGER space probe. The team found that Mercury may once have had a carbon-rich magma ocean, which would have formed when the magma seeped to the surface. However, new data and a reevaluation of mass on the planet’s surface suggests that the mantle is not made of graphite, but precious diamond. The scientists used a large-volume press to replicate conditions below Mercury's crust, with temperatures reaching up to 3,950 degrees Fahrenheit. They believe that diamond could have been formed by two processes: the crystallization of the liquid core of Mercury, which formed 4.5 billion years ago, and slowly crystallized over time.",

The circumstances of her death are still being investigated.",

The footage was captured on the device she was tagged with, revealing the vulnerability of this vulnerable species to boat strikes. The researchers suggest that even when the collisions are not directly fatal, they can cause detrimental changes in behavior and longer-term consequences like injuries. They also warn that boat strikes may be more common than previously considered due to their non-lethal effects once the shark's skin heals, which could potentially underestimate the extent of boat strike prevalence. The scientists recommend more protected areas throughout basking sharks' range to allow them safe places to feed and assess the impact on their recovery.",

Adrian Maguire, an honorary research fellow at the Scottish Association for Marine Science, captured footage of the whale and identified it from its large, crusty white callosities on its skin caused by whale lice, a feature unique only to right whales in the region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List has changed the status of the North Atlantic Right whale to critically endangered in 2020, and estimates that only 200-250 mature individuals remain. Despite these sightings, scientists believe the sighting provides a \"glimmer of hope\" for the population.",

The chicks are bred and reared at LA Zoo as part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's California Condor Recovery Program, which aims to restore the population of the endangered birds. The first egg of the season was laid in January, an early start to the season, and the 17th chick hatched in June. The program aims to release the birds in their native habitat in their natural habitat. The new breeding and rearing techniques were pioneered in 2017 by zoo staff, with no other zoo or California Conder Recovery Program partner having previously attempted this feat. The birds are threatened by habitat loss, pesticide contamination, consumption of micro trash, bird flu, and lead poisoning from eating bullet fragments or shot pellets found in animal carcasses.",

Marco Langbroek, a lecturer in optical space situational awareness at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said that a reusable spacecraft that can interfere with complex satellite networks could have significant value.

Marco Langbroek, a lecturer in optical space situational awareness at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said that a reusable spacecraft that can interfere with complex satellite networks could have significant value. China has not disclosed what technologies the spacecraft has tested, nor has been publicly photographed since it began operating. The current flight of the Chinese spaceplane began in December 2023 and its first flight was in September 2020.",

The charity has been working with an Indigenous population of Chorng people in the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia to protect the small population of these animals, which are considered sacred by the Indigenous people. The conservationists hope this landmark event heralds good things for the future of the species. Only around 1,000 of these estimated 1,300 Siamesed crocodiles are thought to remain in the free wild, with over 300 of them in Cambodia. Fauna and Flora is also working on breeding more Siamesese crocs through captive breeding and recently released an additional 50 juveniles into the wild from captivity. Despite challenges faced by previous wild populations, conservationists believe that if given the right protection, the species will bounce back.",

It provided critical insights on how space weather affects Earth's weather and its impact on satellites and radio signals. Despite losing communication with the satellite in November 2022, ICON had already gathered valuable data on airglow, the relationship between the atmosphere's ions and Earth's magnetic field lines, and the first concrete observation to confirm Earth's ionospheric dynamo.",

The brothers pleaded guilty to a range of offences including unlawfully hunting, possessing antlers without a seal attached, using another person's game seal, and providing false information to an officer. Ryan Reimer, inspector for the provincial Conservation Officer Service, said that social media sleuthing is becoming more frequent due to public tips and hunters' pride in their actions.",

The tech giant has long been rumored to have plans for a clam-style smartphone, previously publishing numerus patents. However, a new report has now revealed that two different-sized prototypes are currently in the works, with suppliers in Asia in talks to produce components for these devices. The report attributes its intel to 'two people with direct knowledge of the matter' who said it typically takes 24 months for a new iPhone model to develop, but this could take longer than usual. The company's industrial design team wants true 'razor' thinness for the iPhone Flip, half as thick as today's iPhones. However there are still challenges facing the foldable phone, including preventing a persistent crease from forming in the middle of the phone's display after repeated use.",

Doctors are hoping to reattach it at the southeast Australian trauma center where McKenzie was taken after the attack. A GoFundMe set up to cover McKenzie's medical costs had raised over $122,000 by Wednesday evening. The incident occurred off the shores of New South Wales, where multiple sharks were encountered in the area. There has reportedly been a spike in great white activity in the region.",

      "summary": "The removal of dams in the Klamath, California, is ahead of schedule to restore the region's natural flows and revive the region’s fish and wildlife, particularly salmon. The dams have blocked access to hundreds of miles of waterways where salmon historically spawned, leading to an increase in salmon numbers by up to 80%. The project aims to remove these dams and open up new spawning habitat to increase chinook salmon by as much as 80% more. The removal of these dams could occur before large numbers of chinook began migrating up the river from the ocean this fall, allowing the fish to reclaim their old home. However, scientists predict that the historic habitat of salmon won't be fully repopulated for a decade or longer.",

The ancient carps were found at the bottom of the Nile River while searching for artifacts lost in a flood in Aswan in the 1970s. The carvations, which were discovered in 1960, were lost during the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Researchers have been able to study the rock formations in the area for the first time and are creating 3D models using photogrammetry to create an accurate three-dimensional version. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism did not provide a translation for the hieroglyphs or describe what the caravings looked like. The researchers hope these findings will help them understand the 18th dynasty's reigns.",

The feat demonstrates that NASA could provide live coverage of a Moon landing during the Artemis missions and could pave the way for optical communications that could connect humans to Mars and beyond. The technology was used to send data using infrared light, which can transmit data 10 to 100 times faster than traditional radio waves. The data was sent via a terrestrial network to NASA’s New Mexico test facility, where scientists controlled the process of beaming data up to the agency’�s Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) satellite 22,000 miles away. Although the Artemis mission has been delayed, the fourth one to return humans to the Moon is scheduled for 2028.",

The explosion, which occurred without warning, left people scrambling for safety as rocks, steam, water and dirt flying into the air. The scientists are working to develop a monitoring system that measures seismic activity, deformations in Earth’s surface and low-frequency acoustic energy that could signal an eruption. The explosions are believed to result from clogged passageways in the natural plumbing network under Yellowstone, which could cause heated water to turn into steam and explode. The incident highlighted a less common and understood type of explosion that is less understood than the ones seen at Old Faithful.",
