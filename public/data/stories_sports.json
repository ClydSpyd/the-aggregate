The clip, which was captured during celebrations in Miami, shows players chanting a song considered racist towards French players of African heritage. French officials and the French soccer federation have condemned the chants. Argentina's conservative vice president, Victoria Villarruel, defended Fernandez and the team, stating that Argentina would not tolerate criticism from a \"colonialist\" country. Despite this, President Milei has been trying to balance nationalism with diplomatic backlash. In addition to meeting with French officials, Milei will attend the 2024 Olympic opening ceremony and hold talks with French business leaders.",

Shepherd credits his commitment to wrestling and willingness to seek out help from others to improve his wrestling.

This comes amid a troubled start to the Olympics for Argentina, which was awarded gold in 2004 and 2008. The game was suspended for nearly two hours after Morocco fans threw bottles to protest a goal that appeared to be an equalizing goal in the 16th minute of added time.

Fans were shocked to see him join the LaLiga minnows, with some expressing concern over his decline. Januzaj made his debut for Manchester United in the 2013 Community Shield and scored five goals and eight assists that hinted at plenty more to come.",

      "summary": "As the Paris Games celebrate the start of the first \"gender-equal Games\" in Paris, female Paralympians are still being marginalised, according to experts. The 2024 Olympics will mark a significant milestone with equal numbers of spots allocated to female and male athletes for the first time. Retired Paralympian Alana Nichols, a three-time gold medallist, said not enough women and girls were entering the para-sport pipeline to achieve equal participation. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) expects about a 55% to 45% split between male and female competitors in Paris. Craig Spence, the IPC's chief brand and communications officer, said there will be 1,860 female slots for the Paris Paralympics, a significant improvement from the 990 available at the 2000 Sydney Games.",

The iconic insulated cup, which holds over a litre of liquid and is made of 90 per cent recycled stainless steel, can only be purchased in-store and requires a Starbucks rewards member to have access to the collaboration. However, once these sky-blue beauties are gone, they will only be available while stocks last. The process involves downloading the Starbucks UK app and purchasing the cup from a Starbucks store or via the Google Play store, using the app to access access. Other versions of the viral Stanley Cups are also available for purchase in the US.",

She fired the first shot in the women’s archery ranking round, marking the passing of the baton from the London 2012 generation. The first world record fell at the hands of Korean Lim Sihyeon, who shot 694 to surpass his compatriot Kang Chae Young’�s previous mark of 692 set in 2019. The ranking round is a curiosity of the Olympic Games and involves all 128 archers shooting 72 arrows each on the same field, with total scores producing seedings for individual and team competition. Tokyo Olympian Bryony Pitman finished 41st, Havers 49th and Penny Healey 52nd, with Team GB seeded 11th for the women's team event.",

This follows a disagreement over a moment he did not like from Fernandes during a match two seasons ago, when he was the captain. Sousess argued that Fernandes should have been one of the last ones to go up during a crucial match against Liverpool. He also stated that leaders in the modern game tend to hide and avoid accountability. Fernandes has faced criticism throughout his time at United for his on-field actions, but has had success at the club since taking over the captaincy from Harry Maguire.",

Dickerson was drafted in the second round, 44th overall by the Nationals in the 2024 MLB Draft and signed for $1.7 million above his slot value of $2,122,200. The contract is the most-ever for a drafted outside the first and supplemental first-round period for a non-first-round player, according to MLB.com’s Jim Callis. The old record second-round pool record was $33.5 million, which the Philadelphia Phillies gave Kevin Gowdy in 2016. Dickenson, a shortstop, hit 18 home runs and was named NJ.com Player of Year after helping Morris Knolls win its second consecutive Group 3 championship and stealing 27 bases.",

      "summary": "The Olympic football team has a history of controversy and controversy at the Games, starting with an \"unofficial\" final between Denmark and Greece in 1896, where the referee, Prince George, was a royal in both nations. The North Korean women's team nearly didn't play at all in 2012 due to a mix-up of screens displaying the South Korean flag by mistake before their match against Colombia. In 2016, USA USA USA goalkeeper Hope Solo labelled Sweden \"a bunch of cowards\" for their team's actions in a penalty shootout. The men’s event kicked off amid tight security as Israel faced Mali in Paris, but Argentina and Morocco had different ideas, with Argentina’ Cristian Medina scoring one of the greatest last-minute pinball equalisers ever seen. The game was suspended after full-time was played for three minutes, leading to a pitch invasion and three more minutes of additional time. The women's event will begin later on Thursday as Canada will face New Zealand.",

Despite acknowledging the \"unprecedented security measures\" in place by French security forces to protect Israelis attending the games, Katz also noted that French authorities have rejected calls from the Left to ban all Israeli participants from the Olympics. There are currently 88 Israeli athletes at the games and they have been given unprecedented protection from both French and Israeli security services. However, there is no evidence linking the alleged attack to the Paris Olympics yet.",

      "summary": "The West Indies cricket team is struggling, with five-day games becoming increasingly shorter. The team's performance has been inconsistent, with Shoaib Bashir's innings leading the way for England. The final Test between the two teams is set to take place at Edgbaston, with the potential for another truncated game. This is not the first time England has defeated West Indies in a Test match in 31 years. Despite these setbacks, the West Indies' top order is learning, with only 17 Tests between them and their veterans, Jason Holder and Shamar Joseph. The decline in standards for the Caribbean team has been attributed to athletics and new sports, structural issues, and franchise franchise issues.",

The loss comes as the league secured a $77 billion deal with Disney, Comcast, and Amazon. Warner Bros. has been broadcasting NBA games on its TNT network since 1989 and reportedly pays $1.2 billion annually for the rights. This loss will impact TNT's NBA-adjacent content, such as \"Inside the NBA.\" Warner Bros.'s statement stated that it had matched Amazon's media rights bid to continue airing NBA games, but the league rejected the offer. The company plans to sue the NBA for violating its contractual rights to air NBA games.",

VIPs at Paris 2024, however, can enjoy alcohol under restrictions limiting alcohol sales at stadiums unless they accompany a meal. The law allows for an exemption from the sale of alcohol for 10 events per organiser per municipality per municipality, and Paris 2024 will host over 700 sessions over 15 days of competition. Local legislation passed in 1991 effectively prevents stadiums from selling alcoholic drinks without a meal, allowing VIPs to enjoy at least a glass or two. However, other fans will have to settle with 500ml of alcohol-free Kronenbourg 1664 for £6.73 (€8), or 400ml of Tourtel Twist’s alcohol-less beer with a twist of lemon for £5.01 (€6). Soft drinks are priced at £4.20 (€5) and water is £2.94 (€3.50) at events. The rule comes after the European Championship in Germany saw low-alcohol beers served at the England vs Serbia game in Gelsenkirchen.",

The Olympic gold medal is approximately $950 based on its use, with over 95.4% of the medal being made of silver (505 grams). Six grams of pure gold, which serves as the plating for the medal, and 18 grams of iron, are reportedly valued at approximately $41,161.50. The bronze medal, which also incorporates elements from the Eiffel Tower, is approximately approximately $486.",

Despite the outcry, FEI president Ingmar de Vos believes equestrians will still be included in the Los Angeles Games in 2028 and Brisbane in 2032. The federation has also released a plan with 37 measures to protect horses, including rules for the tightness of nosebands and flexible cross-country obstacles.",

Tyson was a key member of Beast's team and was frequently attacked as a trans woman, despite her transition. This changed after Tyson was accused of exchanging inappropriate messages with minors, though the full scope of these allegations remains under investigation. Beast has issued his own statement, stating that he took immediate action to remove Tyson from the company, his channel, and any association with MrBeast, while Tyson stated that it was a mutually decided decision and that she would step away. The situation is similar to that of Dr. Disrespect, where it was revealed that he exchanged inappropriate messages and led to a Twitch ban.",

The amount of food available at the canteen is insufficient, according to reports from French newspaper L'Equipe. Eggs and grilled meats reportedly had to be rationed during the breakfast service. Sodexo Live!, the Olympic village's catering partner, confirmed that volumes will be increased to meet the athletes' needs. The Carrefour group, responsible for sourcing 600 tonnes of fresh produce for the Olympics, has also been requested to revise upwards the quantities initially planned. The food service is preparing to serve more than 13 million meals in the next month.",

      "summary": "Olympic swimmer Caeleb Dressel has criticised World Aquatics' handling of a Chinese doping case, expressing lack of confidence in the organisation's handling of the case. Dressel, who has won five golds at the Tokyo Olympics and is one of the most decorated swimmers in Paris, stated he was not confident in the level playing field at the Paris Games. The case began in April when 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned heart medication at a training camp in 2021 but still competed at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. An independent investigation this month ruled the World Anti-Doping agency WADA did not mishandle or show favouritism to China, while a World Aquatic audit concluded there was no mismanagement or cover-up by the governing body.",

The announcement of LeBron James as the male flag bearer for Team USA was criticized by women's sports activist Riley Gaines, who argued that he should have been disqualified due to his controversial stance on the American anthem-kneeling movement. Gaines also highlighted that James was one of the most prominent anthem-knowerers in the liberal activist movement after Colin Kaepernick's rise. James, who was previously criticized for his knee-bowing, has also stated that he will no longer root for his favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys, in 2022 due to their owner's insistence on standing for the national anthem.",

The lightweight star, known as 'The Baddy', revealed that his coach had asked him if he wanted to withdraw from the upcoming fight due to his mental health problems. Pimblett's last fight was in December, when he defeated Tony Ferguson and extended his unbeaten run to a seventh fight. The upcoming fight will take place at Manchester's Co-op Live Arena on July 28. Pimatett's life has changed significantly this year, with him becoming a father for the first time in April.",

The NBA had announced new agreements with Walt Disney's (DIS.N) ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal and Amazon.com in an 11-year deal worth $77 billion. Warner Bros Discovery's shares fell more than 7% in early trading as Macquarie Equity Research downgraded the stock to neutral due to the loss of NBA rights. Some analysts have suggested that the lawsuit could harm Warner's competitiveness in the long run as other leagues may become hesitant to sign deals with them.",

Despite defending himself before a medical commission of the International Olympic Committee, Christie was given the \"benefit of the doubt\" by an 11-10 vote. His career was also marred by a lifetime ban from the British Olympic Association. In 1999, despite initially clearing for nandrolone, the IAAF imposed a two-year ban on Christie.",

Gate 13, where a large proportion of the victims died, was knocked down last month despite assurances from officials that it would remain untouched. The company has stated it will rebuild the new wall according to its original specifications and bricks have been prepared for reconstruction at the site. Protests and legal action against the demolition continued despite families being prevented from getting close to the site and other locations where people died. The tragedy, which claimed 135 lives and injured 700 people, was the worst stadium tragedy for 62 years.",

The event will be held from July 27 to August 4 at Stade Roland Garro. Players such as Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz are expected to lead Team USA’s efforts to maintain its Olympic tennis record. Rafael Nadal will partner with Alaraz in the men’�s doubles, while Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova will team up with Katerina Siniakova for the Czech Republic. Other notable competitors include Andy Murray and Angelique Kerber, who are playing their last tournaments before retirement.

This comes amid reports that a cease-fire in Israel's war in Gaza could be imminent. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has sent a letter to French counterpart Stéphane Séjourné claiming an Iranian-backed plot. The warning may be related to the recent detention of two people accused of plotting terror attacks in France. Paris plans to deploy about 35,000 police officers each day for the Olympics, with a peak of 45,000 for the opening ceremony. Negotiations on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior official said. Former President Donald Trump has criticized those who protested Netanyahy's speech, calling for a one-year jail sentence for those who burned a U.S. flag.",

This decision also resulted in the Russian Olympic Committee being stripped of its gold medal in the team event. The ROC, the skaters involved in the event and the country's figure skating federation had appealed against this ruling. CAS concluded that Valieeva's results were correctly disqualified and that the ROC could not be awarded the gold medal. The International Skating Union demoted the Russian team from gold to bronze following Valieza's disqualification.",

The event is also intended to highlight the importance of the Olympics' climate-related commitments. About 500 participants, including 50 heads of state and government, are expected to attend the summit. The French Alps was named as the 2030 Winter Games host by the International Olympic committee, with conditions including a reduction in emissions. The Paris Olympics had previously set an ambitious target of halving their overall carbon footprint compared to the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Games. Some environmental advocates have questioned the Paris Games' climate track record.",

The Olympic kitchen is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and expects to serve 40,000 meals per day for the Games. Mazia, who grew up in the Côte Sauvage area where food is woven into his memories, is used to cooking for people who live to eat rather than for competitors. He also faces a challenge to serve the sports meals of France, which is renowned worldwide for its cuisine and could be seen as a national shame due to its reputation as a dish representing France.",

The production method, which uses fewer parts per pair, challenges the current footwear manufacturing model which involves shipping finished shoes from factories in Asia to shoppers in the U.S. and Europe. The midsole, foam and plate of the LightSpray shoe are currently produced in Asia, but On plans to manufacture these elements in Switzerland eventually.

However, new manager Emma Hayes has stood by Albert, ignoring fan backlash to select her for the Olympics roster. This aligns with the core values of the USWnt, which has been on the front lines fighting for the LGBT community and raising awareness. The article discusses how Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes changed their mind about the team's stance, stating that they support each other as a family, even if they don't see eye-to-eye. The author suggests that senior players and their players need to find a common ground to resolve these issues.",

Clubs that enter into commercial partnerships with or promote a similar gambling site could be in danger of breaking the law if that site is made available in Britain.",

However, it shows a woman named Sarah Moulds who was cleared of animal cruelty charges in 2023 after a private prosecution was brought over the video by Britain's animal charity. The International Equationary Federation confirmed that the person in the 2021 video is not Dujardenin and that it was not filmed at an FEI event.",

Discovery fell 8% at the open of the day following the NBA's announcement of three major rights deals with three WBD rivals, effectively eliminating the company from professional basketball. This has led some Wall Street analysts to suggest that the company should split or merge, following the Warner Media-Discovery deal. The loss of these key rights means Discovery loses a core content asset for both its linear networks and its Max streaming service. Tim Nollen of Macquarie Equity Research downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “outperform” and stated that while the shares are cheap already, they don’t see a good fundamental investment case now. WBD has threatened to take “appropriate action\" against the NBA, indicating it plans to litigate the decision.",

The Israeli team arrived under a heavy police escort, with motorbike riders at the front and about a dozen riot police vans following. The stadium speaker system played the Israeli anthem to counterbalance the boos and whistles. Once play began, Israeli players were booed each time they touched the ball. Security measures have been heightened for the opening ceremony of the Olympics, with 35,000 police officers per day deployed each day and a peak of 45,000 for the event. France is also receiving assistance from over 40 countries.",

World Athletics will pay gold medal winners $50,000 (£38,700), potentially a significant financial boost for British athletes such as Keely Hodgkinson and Matthew Hudson-Smith. Meanwhile, the International Boxing Association (IBA) has pledged to pay $3.1m (£2.4m) for medalists. Individual nations can also pay fees to their athletes. British athletes rely on sponsorship and endorsement deals, but some have to find alternative sources of income.

He recently stepped up to Manchester City's Elite Development Squad (EDS), where his performances helped the club secure the Premier league 2 title.

She began her career with a record-breaking run in May, breaking the two-minute mark for the first time with a time of 1:57.86, nearly two seconds ahead of the previous European U18 record. Gill's performance has been compared to Keely Hodgkinson's silver medaling at the Tokyo games.",

U.S. men's high performance director Brett McClure, former Olympic silver medallist, agreed that having fans in the stands would be an amazing experience. Defending men's all-around champion Daiki Hashimoto said being in Paris for his second Olympic appearance felt like a first, and that it would be his first time with an audience outside his country.

The Spaniard has been linked with several teams including Alpine, Red Bull, Williams and Mercedes. However, he stated that his best option is a championship-winning car. This could be interpreted as referring to Mercedes, who have not won silverware since 2021. Sainiz's preference for a team leading from the front would suggest that Williams is not currently in the running to secure his signature. There are also rumours that Mercedes is also considering giving a drive to 17-year-old sensation Andrea Kimi Antonelli.",

The most extravagant and elaborate Olympic opening ever, a gala on the River Seine, will kick off the event with nearly equal numbers of men and women. The French capital hopes this will revitalize the Olympics' legacy after two disappointing Olympics. However, security challenges include past and present attacks on athletes and millions of visitors. The Games aim to be less polluting, more sustainable and more socially virtuous than their predecessors. Many of the sports venues are temporary, as Paris didn't want to repeat the mistake of previous Olympic host cities. The opening ceremony will showcase France, its people and history, and the iconic Eiffel Tower.",

      "summary": "The Paris Olympics are set to begin with themes of peace, understanding, and improvements to the human condition. The ancient games, begun in 776 B.C., required a truce in all intercity conflicts in Greece and guaranteed safe travel for all going to Olympia. The Greek emphasis on developing both mind and body extended to two of the greatest education centers of all time, the Academy of Plato and the Lyceum of Aristotle. The modern Olympics began as part of the World's Fair mania of the late 19th century, but the peace ideal was a minor theme. Today, there are numerous Olympic-themed leadership programs that purportedly work for peace. Silvio Laccetti suggests that a change in funding could be made for the Olympians for Peace, a new kind of Olympian chosen from selected and self-selected Olympians.",

The training camp also marks the return of running back Ezekiel Elliott, who was released by the team last March due to a disagreement over a reworked contract. This marks the 45th year the team has trained in Southern California and the 18th season they have spent camp at the Oxnard location.",

The game, which was released after an 11-year hiatus, allows players to be paid for their likeness and performance in one of the hottest video games on the planet. The release of EA Sports' college football game was celebrated by schools across the US and beyond. Players, including freshman quarterback DJ Lagway, and freshman linebacker Myles Graham, grew up playing Madden, the game's NFL equivalent. Despite the absence of previous games for 11 years, EA Sports decided to revive its revered game after the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their brand. Players offered to be featured in the game for a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game, including all Florida's roster.",
