The Dallas-based airline will also add a premium cabin with more legroom and more seating options. The move is part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience and aims to transform customer experience and improve financial performance. The airline has not specified when the changes will go into effect, but plans to provide more details at its Investor Day in late September. The company conducted extensive operational testing and found that 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Booking on initial routes is available starting Thursday, with the first overnight flights set to arrive on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets.",

      "description": "American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares were initially under pressure in Thursday's pre-market hours after reporting earnings, both seeing a bump higher at the start of regular trading hours. American and Southwest signaled margin headwinds tied to airfare prices and capacity pressures. Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd and Bloomberg Intelligence senior aerospace, defense, and airlines industry analyst George Ferguson come onto The Morning Brief to talk about the state of the airline industry and how these travel conditions could shape the landscape in the latter half of 2024. \"Prepare for a bloodbath the rest of the year,\" Boyd tells Yahoo Finance, his sentiments affirmed by Ferguson's belief that capacity numbers could make it \"rough to turn 3Q around, 4Q is always a weak quarter. It's going to be a rough year for the airlines, rougher than I thought.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Barnett, who was diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety after being exposed to a hostile work environment, took his life during a legal battle with the carrier in March. His death came during a break in depositions in his own whistleblower retaliation suit against Boeing. The revelation comes a month after his family filed a lawsuit against Boeing, holding the company responsible for his death. Barnett had previously warned about sub-standard parts being fitted to aircraft on the assembly line and had issued warnings about the 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max models before his sudden death.",

      "summary": "Monzo and Currensea are two options for the best travel payment cards for holiday season, with both allowing for fee-free spending and cash withdrawals abroad. Monzo, an app-only “challenger” bank, was introduced in 2015 as a prepaid card and has since received a full banking licence, attracting over nine million British customers. It is easy to open an account with Monzo and is subject to a \"soft\" credit check, which gives Monzo an assessment of how well you manage your credit, unlike a hard credit check required for borrowing. However, in countries outside of the European Economic Area, you can only withdraw up to £200 worth of cash every 30 days if you withdraw more than this, a 3pc fee is required. CurrenSea's card is linked to an existing bank account, but may still carry out a soft credit check when applying for a new account. Monz's card can be added to your Apple Pay or Google Pay wallet, and users can spend using it anywhere in the world that accepts card payments without paying any fees or charges at all. Curransea's card also converts transaction amount to British pounds using the interbank exchange rate. The company's premium plan costs £25 a year and costs £100 per year, while its premium plan includes a 0.5pc foreign exchange rate and airport lounges.",

However, ticket sales are reportedly at an all-time low, suggesting that British fans may enjoy a summer of sport in the French capital. With around 600,000 tickets still available, bargain hunters may find a better deal due to the availability of last-minute tickets. Many hotels in Paris, including Ibis hotels, were expecting to profit from bookings during the Games and have reportedly doubled their prices, hoping to capitalise on sports fans' interest in the summer Games. Despite these price hikes, the expected demand has not materialised. From July 20-September 8, the cost of a single Metro ticket will increase from €2.15 to €4, bus tickets will double, and the Louvre admission price has already been increased by nearly 30% this year.",

      "summary": "A tourist tourist, @emmagrace.myers, a user on TikTok, has caused a stir with a video showing her attempt to be like an influencer in a vacation video. The video, which has over 2.8 million views and 256,000 likes on the TikTok platform, was viewed as a \"influencer moment\" but ended in a disaster when she slipped into the water. The viral video has received over 930 comments from amused social media users, many calling it relatable and inspiring. However, there are concerns about the effects of over-tourism on Lake Como, which can erode historic buildings and damage seabeds, and make it difficult for locals to find affordable housing. In April, the mayor of Como City, Alessandro Rapinese, was reportedly considering introducing a Venice-style tourist tax to reduce the footfall. In 2019, the Italian government approved a proposal for a 5-euro entry fee for tourists visiting Venice, but its rollout was delayed until spring 2024 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This comes after a police officer was filmed apparently stamping on a man's head at the airport. After the clip was widely shared online, hundreds of protesters gathered outside a Rochdale police station and chanted \"Allahu Akbar\". Labour MPs have also raised concerns with senior officers in Greater Manchester Police regarding the incident. Burnham stated that he would work with the Independent Office for Police Conduct to ensure a high level of neutrality in its investigation. His comments came as Akhmed Yakoob, a lawyer who ran as an independent at the election on a pro-Gaza ticket, released a video of himself with two men arrested at Manchester Airport.",

The RAC has warned of a \"weekend of woe\" as many drivers are expected to be on the road at a significant number of times. The single worst traffic queue is expected on the M5 heading south between Bristol and Bridgwater, as holidaymakers flock to Devon and Cornwall. The number of car trips expected to exceed 2.5 million in comparison to the equivalent period in 2022, with 18.8 million journeys made between July 22-24. RAC Breakdown spokesperson Alice Simpson warned of potential breakdown or accident due to faulty vehicles.",

      "summary": "A proposed light-rail station in north Minneapolis could potentially endanger cyclists and pedestrians, according to some members of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. The Lowry Station, located at the Minneapolis-Robbinsdale border, is part of the $3.2 billion Blue Line extension project, which will connect downtown Minneapolis to Brooklyn Park beginning in 2030. The Park Board was expected to vote on a letter to the Metropolitan Council expressing concerns about the station's street-level design and whether the planning body can legally build a light-Rail line through parkland. Some park board members suggest a safer design could include a tunnel under the Wirth/Victory Memorial Parkway Regional Trail portion of the Grand Rounds network or relocate the station closer to North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale. The initial plan for the Lowry station featured an aerial bridge for light-ra trains and an elevated station above the West Broadway and Lowry Avenue bridges. However, after strong concerns were raised by Park Board commissioners and others, the project's planners discarded the design and started over.",

The footage, which circulated online, appeared to show a uniformed male officer holding a taser over the man before striking him twice. Anderson defended the police officers, stating they faced a \"clear risk\" and should be commended. However, Burnham called Anderson's comments \"irresponsible\" and called the footage \"very disturbing\". An officer has been suspended over the incident at Manchester Airport. The incident sparked a protest outside Rochdale police station and chants of \"shame on you\" were heard. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was now a process following the officer's suspension.",

The upfront price includes three meals a day and snacks, and most of these properties offer family friendly amenities, activities and menus. For week-long stays, all discounts cost less than £699 per person regardless of where you travel from. According to the Post Office Travel Money Spending Report, 36% of Brits book all-Inclusive vacations, ranking them as the second most popular choice, only surpassed by city breaks.",

The airline, which has been studying seating options for over 50 years, is making the changes due to shifting passenger preferences. The changes could generate revenue and improve financial performance. The announcement comes as both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines reported a significant drop in Q2 profit, with both companies reporting higher costs and reduced pricing power. The company's second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier to $367 million, largely due to higher costs for labor, fuel, and other expenses. The change comes as Southwest Airlines is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management, which argues that the airline lags behind in financial performance and has failed to change with the times.",

However, he later abandoned his claim and was declared \"fundamentally dishonest\" by a judge at Canterbury County Court in 2022. The judge found that the accident never happened and declared him as \"fundamentalally dishonest\". He has now been given an eight-month suspended prison sentence for contempt of court. The claim was part of a witness statement from Peter Nicholson, who initially claimed he saw the fall and rushed over to help and call for an ambulance, but was later found to be untrue.",

The town and Jasper National Park, which houses over two million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday when there were 15,000 visitors. The fire is one of hundreds currently burning across Alberta and British Columbia, and Environment Canada is predicting 10 mm to 20 mm of rain for Thursday. The federal government warned in April that this could be one of the worst years ever for fires in Canada. The Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can transport 890,000 barrels per day, is a major focus for help.",

The gifts included a diamond ring, $10,000 in cash, a stay in a luxury hotel room in Dubai, and home landscaping worth over $1,000. Prosecutors alleged that Jafari’s company received about $26 million in task orders under an architectural and engineering contract while Macrina served as commissioner. Chief 11th Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. stated that the jury instruction Kish claimed should have been given at trial seemed to be a \"misstatement of the law\". The Supreme Court recently clarified that whether a gift is a bribe or a gratuity depends on when someone agrees to accept it in exchange for a favor.",

The airline will also add three red-eye flights to Baltimore, with the first landing on Valentine's Day 2025. The change comes amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, who disclosed a nearly $2 billion stake in Southwest and called for new leadership. The changes are part of Southwest's modernization efforts, including faster WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. The company insists that the change will not compromise its operational efficiency and that 80% of its customers and 86% potential customers want an assigned seat.",

      "summary": "Germany's largest airport, Frankfurt Airport, was hit by a major disruption on Thursday, with over one in 10 flights cancelled due to activists from the Last Generation climate group who forced their way onto the airport grounds and stuck themselves to runways. The protest led to the cancellation of about 170 of the 1,400 scheduled flights at Germany's largest, Fraport, and resulted in a temporary suspension of air traffic. The airport has since resumed operations, with passengers advised to expect delays throughout the day. The activists were handed to Hesse state police after being removed from the tarmac. The group claimed responsibility for the disruption, calling for an end to fossil fuel use by 2030. Hesse State Premier Boris Rhein criticised the action, calling it \"irresponsible and criminal climate radicals\" who caused significant damage to holidaymakers. Transport Minister Volker Wissing and Cabinet decided to tighten penalties for air traffic interference, but parliament still needs to vote on the proposal.",

The magazine's editors stated that this year's destinations reflected the collective's desire to reduce stress and responsibilities. While last year's list featured generally cities, this year, TIME chose to include 100 destinations and focus on more specific establishments. The Congo Basin is an ecologically rich and fascinating nature-based vacation, with Kamba African Rainforest Experiences providing visitors with ethical and sustainable access to nature while operating in a low-impact and locally-oriented way. For those with a larger budget, TIME recommends a trip to Antarctica with White Desert, which brings polar explorers and scientists to the interior of the most remote continent on earth. The next season of \"White Lotus\" will be filmed at the Four Seasons Resort in Koh Samui, Thailand.",

The incident sparked a protest outside Rochdale Police Station, with hundreds chanting \"shame on you\". Three of their officers had been assaulted, including a female Pc who suffered a broken nose and four men were arrested. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has called for calm and called for a high standard of conduct from police officers. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has seen the disturbing video and is meeting with Mayor Andy Burningham to discuss the suspension. Independent MP Adnan Hussain described the incident as a \"complete abuse of power\".",

The order includes high-quality pedestrian gates in 20 additional pedestrian lanes and 10 high-security vehicle barrier gates at the airport's new Terminal Concourse and associated areas.

      "summary": "The Economist Intelligence Unit's annual Global Liveability Index has revealed that the world's most liveable cities have settled into a new normal, with the average liveability score barely increasing over the past year. Four European cities and four Asian-Pacific cities made the top 10, with Toronto dropping from the top ten due to a housing crisis. The top 10 also remained remarkably similar to last year's rankings. Vienna, Austria, won the title of world's Most Liveable City for the third consecutive year, scoring perfect scores in four out of five categories, including public transport, healthcare, culture and environment, and numerous universities. Residents expressed their love for living in their cities, particularly in Vienna where tap water comes from the mountains and its cuisine is influenced by Bohemia, Hungary and Italy. Zurich was recently named the world’s Smartest City due to its technological infrastructure and commitment to sustainability.",

      "summary": "Southwest Airlines is discontinuing its open seating model for the first time, replacing it with assigning seats before all flights and offering premium seating options. The move is part of the airline's strategy to improve financial performance, increase its stock price, and enhance customer experience. Since its launch 57 years ago, the airline has had an open seating policy, which allows passengers to choose their seats once they board their flight. Research revealed that 80% of customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat system, and the number one reason a passenger chooses a competitor is the open model. The airline also plans to introduce premium seating with extended legroom, with potentially up to one-third of a cabin being allocated to this type of seat. The changes were announced on the same day as Southwest reported a significant drop in profits for the second quarter of the year.",

Ford Motor Co. fell more than 13% in premarket after reporting that its Q2 net income fell 4.7% due to rising warranty and recall costs. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. jumped 9.4% after posting strong financial results that exceeded Wall Street expectations. The government is expected to release its first estimate of how the U.S. economy performed in Q2.",

He accused the party of \"jaw-dropping\" hypocrisy, with ministers \"hopping on and off\" an Airbus A321 and asking if this was compatible with their aim of restoring trust in politicians. This follows Foreign Secretary David Lammy's use of the private jet earlier this week. Labour has previously criticised Tory ministers for using the plane, particularly in 2022 when the then-foreign secretary Liz Truss used it to travel to Australia. Commons Leader Lucy Powell responded by saying that the Prime Minister's travel arrangements are a security matter.",

The second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier to $367 million, due to higher costs for labor, fuel, and other expenses. American Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit to $717 million and said it would break even in the third quarter, well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit. The announcement comes as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management, who argues that the airline lags behind in financial performance and wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.",

The Florida Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday will take effect across the state starting on Monday, July 29. The National Center for Education Statistics lists the minimum 180 days of school for Florida students, a time typical across the country, and Florida does not require a minimum number of hours per school day. New legislation signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023 will require later start times for middle and high schools throughout Florida, with middle schools barred from starting the “instructional day” earlier than 8 a.m., while high schools will be barred from beginning the school day before 8:30 am.",

The National Park Service (NPS) reported that he lost his flip-flops during a walk and had to be rescued due to the heat. Park rangers had to transport the man to a hospital due to his severe burns and pain. However, there was difficulty as Mercy Air's helicopter couldn't land safely in the area due to extreme heat conditions. The NPS issued an \"extreme summer heat\" danger alert for Death Valley and warned of high temperatures of 100°F to 130°F. They also advised visitors to plan ahead to prevent heat-related illnesses like heat rash and heat stroke, which can lead to brain damage or injury vital organs.",

Aviation experts believe this was due to \"pure human error\" as the Boeing 737 Max departed from Columbus, Ohio, and was headed to Tampa, Florida. Richard Curran, a professor of Aviation Management at City University of London, and Mark Stephens, a retired Delta Air Lines pilot, warned that the aircraft should have been at least 1,000 clear of the water and its \"dangerously low\" position could have a disastrous impact. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the cause of the incident. This is not the first time a Southwest flight has dropped to a dangerously low altitude; in June, a plane was found to have dropped to 525 feet when it was 9 miles from landing in Oklahoma City.",

The airline plans to switch to assigned seating and streamline its boarding process to appeal to both new and existing customers, with four out of five preferring assigned seats. This is part of several major operational changes, including introducing premium seating options on all flights and introducing red-eye flights. While specific cabin layout details are still in design, Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with industry peers. The changes are designed to elevate the customer experience, improve financial performance, and drive shareholder value without sacrificing operational efficiency.",

The changes come as Southwest reported its second quarter results, which beat some expectations but fell short in other key areas. The company did not specify when the changes would go into effect but will provide more details in late September. The change comes amid criticism from an activist investor and $231 million in first-quarter losses, and a series of potentially dangerous incidents.",

The event was held July 10-15 at Phil Foster Park, Lake Park Marina and other locations throughout the county. Price, a graduate of the Benjamin School in North Palm Beach, was a \"pioneering instructor\" in the area who offered continuing education and training for freedivers. His body has not been recovered. The six-day festival featured 30 freedivers and featured a series of competitive and recreational events.",

The airline confirmed that safety is its top priority and has zero tolerance for staff who violate its alcohol and other drugs policy. According to Cathay's operational manual, a breath test failure for employees in safety-sensitive roles can result in a reading greater than 9 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, which is stricter than Hong Kong's drink-driving limit. Pilots are prohibited from using cannabis, cocaine and other illicit psychoactive substances without a valid prescription. The company also advises pilots not to fly if they are dependent on medication, and never to immediately start a new medication.",

The company will also offer overnight “red-eye” flights for its first time, which it claims will increase revenue and cost savings without additional aircraft capital deployment. Despite this, Southwest has been under pressure from Elliott Investment Management, a firm owned by Paul Singer, an activist investor who took a $1.9 billion stake in the airline.

The holidays are available for less than £700pp and include return flights with baggage allowance, accommodation, and shared resort transfers. Travel options include short-haul holidays in Spain, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, and many more. However, flexibility may be a key to securing the cheapest deal, as empty seats or hotel rooms may increase the price later. Last-minute holidays can also be found to be the cheapest due to empty seats on flights or hotel room reservations.",

Travel expert Annabel Symonds believes that Luskentre Beach, which is also known as one of the best beaches in the world, resembles Australia's Queensland Beach. The beach is known for having a soft, powdery texture and comfortable for sunbathing and relaxing with a book. It is also a great place to observe wildlife, with sightings of dolphins, red deer or golden eagles. Luskentye Beach has been named one of Europe's most stunning beaches by Lonely Planet and has also been named the Beach of the Year in the Countryfile Magazine Awards.",

The Wall Street Journal named the best airport in the country in 2023, and it also ranked highly for on-time performance and customer experience in a study released in 2024. The airport changed hands several times before being purchased by the city of Phoenix for $100,000 in 1935.

      "summary": "Budgeting for a Florida vacation can be difficult, especially if you don't know what city you're visiting. The cost of a week in Destin, Florida, is estimated at $2,683, with accommodations being the largest expense at $222 a day. St. Augustine, Florida's oldest city, is an excellent destination for exploring historical sites and museums. A one-week trip to Cape Canaveral for two people averages $3,078, largely due to higher costs for accommodations. A single-week vacation to Ocala averages $1,169, considerably cheaper than some Florida beach destinations. Orlando is one of Florida’s pricier destinations, with an average of $4,488 for a two-person trip.",
